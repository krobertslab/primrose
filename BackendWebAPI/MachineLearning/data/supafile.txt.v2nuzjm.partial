Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account only for a relatively small proportion of breast cancers, even within the group of familiar clusters, they seem to be virtually non-existing in sporadic breast cancers. A substantial proportion of familiar breast cancer clusters has failed to provide evidence for an association with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, thus we have to look forward to the identification of additional breast cancer susceptibility genes. What has been most disappointing is that the mutation status of BRCA1/2 can provide only limited information for cancer risk. Initial assessments had indicated a risk of close to 90% for mutation carriers to develop breast cancer until age 75 - a value that turned out to be restricted to high-risk families in which the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes had been genomically mapped. In unselected clusters the risk appears much lower, some estimates suggest less than 40%. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 large encode proteins that appear to have a plethora of functions, with a conspicuous association to DNA repair and DNA recombination, and probably transcription activation. Defects in DNA repair can result in cancer predisposition syndromes and are recognized as being instrumental in cancer progression.

In this article we discuss why family history is no substitute for hereditary breast cancer with regard to studying survival and possible reasons why studies using family history yield contradictory results, why BRCA2-associated breast cancer should be considered a unique entity, and what methodological problems may exist, especially with regard to family-based studies.\n\nRESULTS: Five studies have reported on survival in BRCA2-associated breast cancer. Two studies showed a statistically significant worse survival for BRCA2 patients, but the patients from one of these studies were later claimed to have a trend toward better prognosis when controls were matched for age and year of diagnosis. The other study found that the unfavorable prognosis of BRCA2 patients was, to a great extent, due to a worse stage of the disease at time of diagnosis. The remaining three studies showed no significant effect of germline BRCA2 mutations on survival. The numbers of BRCA2 patients investigated in these studies were 42, 20, 23, 28, and 54 patients.

Because most disease-associated BRCA2 mutations are protein-truncating mutations, a test for truncated BRCA2 proteins should identify most BRCA2 hereditary cancers.\n\nMETHODS: We have developed a tissue truncation test to identify truncated BRCA2 proteins in breast cancer tissue biopsies in vivo that does not use amplification or genetic manipulations. N-terminal and C-terminal antibodies are used to visualize protein truncation by demonstrating that the beginning of the protein is present but the end (ie, terminus) is absent.\n\nRESULTS: A quantitative C-terminal immunostaining score or a C-terminal to N-terminal truncation ratio correctly classified 20 of 21 breast cancers arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers and 57 of 58 cancers arising outside the context of a multiple-case breast cancer family. This represents a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 98%. Because of the presence of C-terminal BRCA2 protein and atypical clinical features of the misclassified cancer in a BRCA2 mutation carrier, we performed polymerase chain reaction and sequence analyses on this cancer. The results showed continued presence of the BRCA2 wild-type allele in the cancer, which indicated that intact BRCA2 protein was present in this cancer.\n\nCONCLUSION: This immunohistochemistry-based test (which takes only 4 hours) appears to identify BRCA2 hereditary cancer with high accuracy.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in DNA repair and regulation of centrosome number. Loss of either of these functions would be expected to lead to chromosomal instability, which is observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated tumours. Taken together, these studies give an insight into the pathogenesis of BRCA-associated tumours and will inform future therapeutic strategies."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17972172", "_score": 466.73053, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Smoking [D012907:major]", "Age Factors [D000367:minor]", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins [D051017:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]"], "text": "Smoking and risk of breast cancer in carriers of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 aged less than 50 years.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Cigarette smoke contains compounds that may damage DNA, and the repair of damage may be impaired in women with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, the effect of cigarette smoking on breast cancer risk in mutation carriers is the subject of conflicting reports. We have examined the relation between smoking and breast cancer risk in non-Hispanic white women under the age of 50 years who carry a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a case-control study using data from carriers of mutations in BRCA1 (195 cases and 302 controls) and BRCA2 (128 cases and 179 controls). Personal information, including smoking history, was collected using a common structured questionnaire by eight recruitment sites in four countries. Odds-ratios (OR) for breast cancer risk according to smoking were adjusted for age, family history, parity, alcohol use, and recruitment site.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to non-smokers, the OR for risk of breast cancer for women with five or more pack-years of smoking was 2.3 (95% confidence interval 1.6-3.5) for BRCA1 carriers and 2.6 (1.8-3.9) for BRCA2 carriers. Risk increased 7% per pack-year (p<0.001) in both groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that smoking is associated with increased risk of breast cancer before age 50 years in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. If confirmed, they provide a practical way for carriers to reduce their risks. Previous studies in prevalent mutation carriers have not shown smoking to increase risk of breast cancer, but are subject to bias, because smoking decreases survival after breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17920891", "_score": 466.65253, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]"], "text": "Clinically relevant biology of hereditary breast cancer.\n\n\nThe identification of the two major breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 has led to an explosion of work covering the biology and epidemiology of these genes.

We recently demonstrated that the progression of breast cancer in female carriers of a germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation follows specific genetic pathways, distinct from each other and from sporadic breast cancer. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide survey by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) of somatic genetic aberrations in 26 male breast cancers, including five tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers. BRCA2 tumors exhibited a significantly higher number of chromosomal aberrations than sporadic tumors. The most common alterations in sporadic male breast cancer were +1q (38%), +8q (33%), +17q (33%), -13q (29%), and -8p (24%). In tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers, the five most common genetic changes were +8q (100%), +20q (100%), +17q (80%), -13q (80%), and -6q (60%). The CGH results in these two groups of male breast cancers are almost identical to those identified in the corresponding sporadic and BRCA2-associated female breast cancers. The results suggest that despite substantial hormonal differences between females and males, similar genetic changes are selected for during tumor progression.

Meanwhile, an understanding of the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the DNA damage response pathway has lead to the identification of a number of breast cancer susceptibility genes including PALB2, CHEK2, ATM and BRIP1, all of which interact directly or indirectly with BRCA1 or BRCA2. Knowledge of how BRCA1 and BRCA2 maintain genomic integrity has also led the development of novel targeted therapies.

The identification of genetic modifiers of breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers will lead to an improved understanding of breast cancer and may prove useful for the determination of individualized risk of cancer amongst carriers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20878484", "_score": 452.8858, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Italy [D007558:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Nuclear Localization Signals [D019913:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid [D012689:minor]", "Women's Health [D016387:minor]", "Base Sequence [D001483:minor]", "Breast [D001940:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/prevention & control [Q000517:major]", "Exons [D005091:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Frameshift Mutation [D016368:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]"], "text": "A new mutation of BRCA2 gene in an Italian healthy woman with familial breast cancer history.\n\n\nHeterozygous germ line mutations in the Breast CAncer1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 genes can lead to a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer, in addition to a significantly increased susceptibility of pancreatic, prostate and male breast cancer.

Using this method we firstly document alterations in pathway-specific DSB repair activities in primary cells originating from familial as well as sporadic breast cancer. In particular, we identified increases in the mutagenic nonhomologous end joining and single-strand annealing mechanisms in sporadic breast cancers with wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2, and, thus, similar phenotypes to tumors with mutant alleles of BRCA1 and BRCA2. This suggests that detection of error-prone DSB repair activities may be useful to extend the limits of genotypic characterization of high-risk susceptibility genes. This method may, therefore, serve as a marker for breast cancer risk assessment and, even more importantly, for the prediction of responsiveness to targeted therapies such as to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP1)."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "24285858", "_score": 449.73193, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome [D061325:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Netherlands [D009426:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Young Adult [D055815:minor]", "Age Distribution [D017677:minor]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Founder Effect [D018703:major]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Breast and ovarian cancer risks in a large series of clinically ascertained families with a high proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Dutch founder mutations.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations confer increased risks of breast and ovarian cancer, but risks have been found to vary across studies and populations.\n\nMETHODS: We ascertained pedigree data of 582 BRCA1 and 176 BRCA2 families and studied the variation in breast and ovarian cancer risks using a modified segregation analysis model.\n\nRESULTS: The average cumulative breast cancer risk by age 70 years was estimated to be 45% (95% CI 36 to 52%) for BRCA1 and 27% (95% CI 14 to 38%) for BRCA2 mutation carriers.

Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for the majority of high risk families with both early onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Most of the families with less than six breast cancer cases and no ovarian cancer do not carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations that can be detected using routine sequencing protocols. Here, we aimed to review the etiology of familial breast cancer in cases without BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\nRESULTS: After excluding BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, factors proposed to contribute to familial breast cancer include: chance clustering of apparently sporadic cases, shared lifestyle, monogenic inheritance, i.e., dominant gene mutations associated with a high risk (TP53, PTEN, STK11), dominant gene mutations associated with a relatively low risk (ATM, BRIP1, RLB2), recessive gene mutations associated with horizontal inheritance patterns (sister-sister), and polygenic inheritance where susceptibility to familial breast cancer is thought to be conferred by a large number of low risk alleles.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that in the majority of cases with BRCA1 and BRCA2 negative familial breast cancer the etiology is due to interactions of intermediate or low risk alleles with environmental and lifestyle factors. Thus, a careful selection of patients submitted to genetic testing is needed.

As one of these potential mechanisms, we investigated whether allelic imbalance (AI) of BRCA1 or BRCA2 expression was associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. By developing a quantitative approach utilizing allele-specific real-time PCR, we first evaluated AI caused by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in patients with frameshift mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We next measured AI for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in lymphocytes from three groups: familial breast cancer patients, non-familial breast cancer patients and age-matched cancer-free females. The AI ratios of BRCA1, but not BRCA2, in the lymphocytes from familial breast cancer patients were found to be significantly increased as compared to cancer-free women (BRCA1: 0.424 versus 0.211, P = 0.00001; BRCA2: 0.206 versus 0.172, P = 0.38).

The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins function in DNA repair in conjunction with RAD51. A preliminary report suggested that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region of RAD51 (135C/G) increases breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.

Clinical observations suggest important differences in the natural history between breast cancers due to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, potentially requiring different screening guidelines.\n\nMETHODS: Three studies of mutation carriers using annual MRI and mammography were analyzed.

BRCA1/BRCA2 genes help maintain genome stability and assist in DNA repair. We examined whether the risk of CBC associated with radiation treatment was higher among women with germline BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations than among non-carriers.\n\nMETHODS: A population-based, nested case-control study was conducted within a cohort of 52,536 survivors of unilateral breast cancer (UBC). Cases were 603 women with CBC and controls were 1199 women with UBC individually matched on age at diagnosis, race, year of first diagnosis and cancer registry. All women were tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. Radiation absorbed dose from the initial radiotherapy (RT) to the CBC location within the contralateral breast was reconstructed from measurements in a tissue-equivalent phantom and details available in the therapy records.\n\nFINDINGS: Among women treated with radiation, the mean radiation dose was 1.1 Gy (range = 0.02-6.2 Gy). Risk of developing CBC was elevated among women who carried a deleterious BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation (rate ratio, RR = 4.5, confidence interval, CI = 3.0-6.8), and also among those treated with RT (RR = 1.2, CI = 1.0-1.6). However, among mutation carriers, an incremental increase in risk associated with radiation dose was not statistically significant.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Multiplicative interaction of RT with mutation status would be reflected by a larger association of RT with CBC among carriers than among non-carriers, but this was not apparent. Accordingly, there was no clear indication that carriers of deleterious BRCA/BRCA2 mutations were more susceptible to the carcinogenic effects of radiation than non-carriers.

We studied BRCA2 protein expression and S3291 phosphorylation in normal breast tissues and in sporadic breast cancers and observed that BRCA2 is expressed and phosphorylated in normal breast and 10 ER(+) breast cancers but not in 10 ER(-) breast cancers. In order to study this correlation between ER and BRCA2 expression, we studied ER(+) breast cancer cell lines. We found that a rapid increase in BRCA2 S3291 phosphorylation occurs following 17-beta-oestradiol (E2) treatment. This increase seen in BRCA2 total and phospho-S3291 protein levels was found to be unaffected with cycloheximide pre-treatment, but decreased following tamoxifen, ICI 182,780 or roscovitine treatment. This suggests a requirement for ER and cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase) in mediating the increased protein levels. MCF7 cell cycle distribution analysis following E2, in both the presence and absence of roscovitine (a cdk inhibitor), did not demonstrate any changes during an 8 h period, which further supports our hypothesis that mitogenic effects of E2 are not predominant at early time points. Studies with MG132 proteasome inhibitor and siRNA to skp2 support a model in which skp2-mediated proteasomal degradation of BRCA2 rapidly degrades BRCA2 protein in the absence of hormone treatment, which likely inhibits this pathway. E2 was shown to improve survival of MCF7 cells upon radiation treatment and roscovitine partially reversed this effect.

In contrast to large truncations of PALB2, which display a complete loss of interaction, the L939W, T1030I and L1143P missense mutants/variants of the PALB2 WD40 domain are associated with altered patterns of direct binding to the RAD51C, RAD51 and BRCA2 HR proteins in biochemical assays. Further, the T1030I missense mutant is unstable, whereas the L939W and L1143P proteins are stable but partially disrupt the PALB2-RAD51C-BRCA2 complex in cells. Functionally, the L939W and L1143P mutants display a decreased capacity for DNA double-strand break-induced HR and an increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation.

Total RNA was analyzed for the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 naturally occurring and pathological transcripts using RT-PCR.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 may maintain the integrity of the genome by regulating expression of genes directly involved in this process. Alternatively, if the functions are not related, which is required for suppression of tumorigenesis? Researchers also are grappling with another paradox. If BRCA1 and BRCA2 are ubiquitously expressed, why do mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead specifically to tumors primarily of the breast and ovary, as well as a limited number of other tissues to a lesser degree? Nothing to date has been revealed that would explain how alteration of the transcriptional regulatory function and or the DNA repair function ascribed to BRCA1 and BRCA2 would result in tumor specificity as both of these functions are essential to a broad spectrum of tissues. It is possible that BRCAI and BRCA2 may regulate genes expressed only in the breast and ovary. Similarly, there may be unidentified BRCA1 and BRCA2 co-factors that are active only in the breast and ovary and, therefore, are critical to tumorigenesis. All breast cancer is genetic, although only a small fraction of cases are attributable to inherited genetic predisposition. Most breast cancer is due to genetic alterations that are specific to breast epithelial cells, many of which remain unknown. Integration of genetic approaches into research designed to elucidate biological pathways of breast cancer tumorigenesis will ultimately lead to new information critical to the development of new tools for the diagnosis and treatment of disease."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "12527904", "_score": 442.072, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Recombinant Proteins [D011994:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Replication Protein A [D051716:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Chromatography, Affinity [D002846:minor]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Precipitin Tests [D011233:minor]", "Protein Binding [D011485:minor]"], "text": "Interaction between BRCA2 and replication protein A is compromised by a cancer-predisposing mutation in BRCA2.\n\n\nMutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes predispose women to familial, early-onset breast cancer.

In experiments reported here, we have used protein affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation techniques to show that the putative N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain of BRCA2 interacts with replication protein A (RPA), a protein essential for DNA repair, replication and recombination. This interaction was not mediated by DNA and was specific for human RPA but not yeast RPA. Since the cancer-predisposing mutation Y42C in BRCA2 significantly compromised the interaction between RPA and BRCA2, this interaction may be biologically important. That BRCA2 protein in HeLa cell extract also coimmunoprecipitated with RPA suggested that this interaction occurs in vivo.

Only one of these has reported an estimate of the breast cancer risk associated with a mutation in these genes, and there is no published ovarian cancer risk estimate derived from a population-based case series. We screened a population-based series of breast cancer cases diagnosed before the age of 55 for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Pedigree information from the mutation carriers was used to estimate penetrance and the proportion of familial risk of breast cancer due to BRCA1 and BRCA2. We identified eight (0.7%) BRCA1 and 16 (1.3%) BRCA2 mutation carriers in 1220 breast cancer cases (actual sample size 1435 adjusted for 15% polymerase chain reaction failure rate). Mutation prevalence was substantially higher in cases diagnosed before 35 years-of-age and with increasing number of relatives affected with breast or ovarian cancer. However, most mutation carriers were diagnosed in the older age groups, and a minority reported a first-degree relative with breast cancer. Breast cancer penetrance by age 80 was estimated to be 48% (95% CI 7-82%) for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 74% (7-94%) for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Ovarian cancer penetrance for BRCA1 and BRCA2 combined was 22% (6-65%) by age 80. 17% of the familial risk of breast cancer was attributable to BRCA1 and BRCA2. At birth, the estimated prevalence of BRCA1 mutation carriers was 0.07% or 0.09% depending on the penetrance function used for the calculation. For BRCA2, the birth prevalence estimates were 0.14% and 0.22%. Mutations in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are rare in the population and account for a small fraction of all breast cancer in the UK.

However, the molecular mechanism of BRCA2 in DNA damage repair remains elusive. Unexpectedly, we found that the OB-folds of BRCA2 recognize poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and mediate the fast recruitment of BRCA2 to DNA lesions, which is suppressed by PARP inhibitor treatment. Cancer-associated mutations in the OB-folds of BRCA2 disrupt the interaction with PAR and abolish the fast relocation of BRCA2 to DNA lesions. The quickly recruited BRCA2 is important for the early recruitment of exonuclease 1(EXO1) and is involved in DNA end resection, the first step of homologous recombination (HR).

The effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer incidence among women at extremely high risk due to inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations is unknown.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of tamoxifen on incidence of breast cancer among cancer-free women with inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Genomic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 for 288 women who developed breast cancer after entry into the randomized, double-blind Breast Cancer Prevention Trial of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (between April 1, 1992, and September 30, 1999).\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Among women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, incidence of breast cancer among those who were receiving tamoxifen vs incidence of breast cancer among those receiving placebo.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 288 breast cancer cases, 19 (6.6%) inherited disease-predisposing BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Of 8 patients with BRCA1 mutations, 5 received tamoxifen and 3 received placebo (risk ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-10.70).

Inherited susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are considered in breast, ovarian and other common cancers etiology. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been identified that confer a high degree of breast cancer risk.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Our study was performed to identify germline mutations in some exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes for the early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer in females.\n\nMETHODS: This study was applied on Egyptian healthy females who first degree relatives to those, with or without a family history, infected with breast cancer. Sixty breast cancer patients, derived from 60 families, were selected for molecular genetic testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The study also included 120 healthy first degree female relatives of the patients, either sisters and/or daughters, for early detection of presymptomatic breast cancer mutation carriers. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes of all the studied subjects. Universal primers were used to amplify four regions of the BRCA1 gene (exons 2,8,13 and 22) and one region (exon 9) of BRCA2 gene using specific PCR. The polymerase chain reaction was carried out. Single strand conformation polymorphism assay and heteroduplex analysis were used to screen for mutations in the studied exons. In addition, DNA sequencing of the normal and mutated exons were performed.\n\nRESULTS: Mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were detected in 86.7% of the families. Current study indicates that 60% of these families were attributable to BRCA1 mutations, while 26.7% of them were attributable to BRCA2 mutations. Results showed that four mutations were detected in the BRCA1 gene, while one mutation was detected in the BRCA2 gene. Asymptomatic relatives, 80 (67%) out of total 120, were mutation carriers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes mutations are responsible for a significant proportion of breast cancer.

However, there is little evidence that genomic rearrangements are a major factor in BRCA2 associated breast cancer and the frequencies of rearrangements in BRCA1 in large clinic based populations are unknown.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a large clinic based population at high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification was used to comprehensively screen BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 in 312 index cases.\n\nRESULTS: Three novel deletions detected in BRCA2 were found exclusively in families with at least one case of male breast cancer.

As EMSY is located on 11q13 in proximity to CCND1, an established breast cancer oncogene, we also examined the amplification of CCND1 in the same tumor cohort. Amplification of EMSY and CCND1 were examined in 58 BRCA1-associated, 64 BRCA2-associated, and 242 familial non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast cancers using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). All tumors had a centralized pathology review and underwent molecular phenotyping by immunohistochemical profiling on tissue microarrays (TMAs). Tumors with amplification of EMSY and/or CCND1 were compared with non-amplified tumors for morphological appearance, molecular subtype, and overall survival. EMSY amplification was detected in 8% of BRCA1-associated, 0% of BRCA2-associated, and 9% of familial non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast tumors (P = 0.036). CCND1 was amplified in 4% of BRCA1-associated, 13% of BRCA2-associated and 21% of non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast tumors (P = 0.054). EMSY was amplified independently of CCND1 in 38% of cases. EMSY amplification was associated with increased tumor stage only; whereas CCND1 amplification was associated with high tumor grade, ER positivity, and inversely associated with the basal-like phenotype. There was a trend toward worse overall survival in ER-positive non-BRCA1/BRCA2 familial breast cancer patients whose tumors exhibited EMSY and CCND1 co-amplification. BRCA2-associated breast tumors are less likely than non-BRCA1/BRCA2 familial breast cancers to exhibit EMSY amplification. BRCA1-associated breast cancers are less likely than non-BRCA1/BRCA2 familial breast cancers to exhibit CCND1 amplification.

Similarly, the canine BRCA2 gene locus has been associated with mammary tumors in female dogs. However, deleterious mutations in canine BRCA2 have not been reported, thus far. The BRCA2 protein is involved in homologous recombination repair via its interaction with RAD51 recombinase, an interaction mediated by 8 BRC repeats. These repeats are 26-amino acid, conserved motifs in mammalian BRCA2. Previous structural analyses of cancer-associated mutations affecting the BRC repeats have shown that the weakening of RAD51's affinity for even 1 repeat is sufficient to increase breast cancer susceptibility. In this study, we focused on 2 previously reported canine BRCA2 mutations (T1425P and K1435R) in BRC repeat 3 (BRC3), derived from mammary tumor samples. These mutations affected the interaction of canine BRC3 with RAD51, and were considered deleterious. Two BRC3 mutations (K1440R and K1440E), reported in human breast cancer patients, occur at amino acids corresponding to those of the K1435R mutation in dogs. These mutations affected the interaction of canine BRC3 with RAD51, and may also be considered deleterious. The two BRC3 mutations and a substitution (T1430P), corresponding to T1425P in canine BRCA2, were examined for their effects on human BRC3 function and the results were compared between species.

Germline mutations of a second cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 (ref. 5), are associated with a strong predisposition to ovarian cancer as well as female breast cancer. Recent studies have suggested that the phenotype in BRCA1 families with respect to the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer varies with the location of the BRCA1 mutation. To determine whether germline mutations in BRCA2 are associated with a similar variation in phenotypic risk, we have analysed the distribution of mutations in 25 families with multiple cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer ascertained in the United Kingdom and Eire. These mutations all lead to premature truncation of BRCA2 as a result of frameshift deletions/insertions or nonsense mutations. Analysis of the mutation distribution along the length of the gene indicates a significant genotype-phenotype correlation. Truncating mutations in families with the highest risk of ovarian cancer relative to breast cancer are clustered in a region of approximately 3.3 kb in exon 11 (P = 0.0004).

In this study, we evaluated factors associated with the decision to undergo BRCA1/BRCA2 gene testing at the time of initial breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nMETHODS: Participants were newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who had not yet received definitive local breast cancer treatment and who had a family history consistent with hereditary breast cancer. Participants were offered genetic counseling and BRCA1/BRCA2 testing with results in 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nRESULTS: Of 231 patients who referred to the study, 20 (9%) declined the baseline interview, 34 (15%) completed a baseline interview but declined genetic testing, and 177 (76%) underwent BRCA1/BRCA2 testing.

In this study, we proposed a novel functional HR-based assay that determines the effect of the transient overexpression of the BRCA2 variant on spontaneous HR. This assay will help one in the difficult task of classifying UCVs, and it will give more information on how BRCA2 may induce genome instability and on the basic mechanism of BRCA2-induced tumourigenesis.

A combined analysis was performed to address this uncertainty.\n\nMETHODS: Two retrospective cohorts of Ashkenazi Jewish women undergoing breast-conserving treatment for invasive cancer between 1980 and 1995 (n = 584) were established. Archived tissue blocks were used as the source of DNA for Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutation analysis. Paraffin-embedded tissue and follow-up information was available for 505 women.\n\nRESULTS: Genotyping was successful in 496 women, of whom 56 (11.3%) were found to carry a BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutation. After a median follow-up period of 116 months, breast cancer specific survival was worse in women with BRCA1 mutations than in those without (62% at 10 years versus 86%; P < 0.0001), but not in women with the BRCA2 mutation (84% versus 86% at 10 years; P = 0.76). Germline BRCA1 mutations were an independent predictor of breast cancer mortality in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.2-4.8; P = 0.01). BRCA1 status predicted breast cancer mortality only among women who did not receive chemotherapy (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% confidence interval 2.0-11.7; P = 0.001). The risk for metachronous ipsilateral cancer was not greater in women with germline BRCA1/BRCA2 founder mutations than in those without mutations (P = 0.68).\n\nCONCLUSION: BRCA1 mutations, but not BRCA2 mutations, are associated with reduced survival in Ashkenazi women undergoing breast-conserving treatment for invasive breast cancer, but the poor prognosis associated with germline BRCA1 mutations is mitigated by adjuvant chemotherapy.

Clarifying the role of breastfeeding among women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation may be helpful for risk assessment and for recommendations regarding prevention. We present an updated analysis of breastfeeding and risk of breast cancer using a large matched sample of BRCA mutation carriers.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 1,665 pairs of women with a deleterious mutation in either BRCA1 (n = 1,243 pairs) or BRCA2 (n = 422 pairs). Breast cancer cases and unaffected controls were matched on year of birth, mutation status, country of residence and parity. Information about reproductive factors, including breastfeeding for each live birth, was collected from a routinely administered questionnaire. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between ever having breastfed, as well as total duration of breastfeeding, and the risk of breast cancer.\n\nRESULTS: Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, breastfeeding for at least one year was associated with a 32% reduction in risk (OR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91; P = 0.008); breastfeeding for two or more years conferred a greater reduction in risk (OR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.74). Among BRCA2 mutation carriers, there was no significant association between breastfeeding for at least one year and breast cancer risk (OR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.31; P = 0.43).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These data extend our previous findings that breastfeeding protects against BRCA1-, but not BRCA2-associated breast cancer.

Clinical information and blood samples were obtained from all patients. A comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutational analysis was performed using the protein truncation assay and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis followed by DNA sequencing of variant signals detected by these assays. Five different deleterious germline mutations including four frameshift mutations and one missense mutation were identified, three in BRCA1 (3.3%) and two mutations (2.2%) in BRCA2. Both BRCA2 mutations are novel and might be specific for the German population. An additional BRCA1 missense mutation previously described and classified as an unknown variant was found. This mutation was also detected in two breast cancer patients of family P 328 and not in 140 healthy controls suggesting that it is disease associated. In addition, one common polymorphism and five novel intronic sequence variants with unknown significance were found.

In the general population, breast cancer risk is affected by age at menarche, by age at first birth, by the number of births and by the duration of breast feeding. Whether this is true for mutation carriers is not clear.\n\nMETHODS: In a case-control study, nested in a population-based cohort of the Icelandic Cancer Detection Clinic, two groups of cases were defined, matched on year of birth, on age at diagnosis and on age when giving information on reproductive factors: 100 carriers of the Icelandic founder BRCA2 mutation 999del5, and 361 BRCA2-negative cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 48 years. There were 1000 women in a matched group of unaffected controls. Conditional logistic regression was used for the analysis.\n\nRESULTS: An increased number of births was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in BRCA2-negative cases but not in BRCA2-positive cases. A negative association between risk and duration of breast feeding was observed only in the mutation carriers. These associations were not statistically significant, but the effects of the two variables differed significantly according to mutation status (P = 0.007 and P = 0.045 for interaction with number of births and with duration of breast feeding, respectively). This was maintained when limiting the analysis to women diagnosed older than the age of 40 years.\n\nCONCLUSION: The association between breast cancer and the number of pregnancies and between breast cancer and the duration of breast feeding was not the same for carriers and noncarriers of a detrimental BRCA2 mutation.

Men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were more likely to have a family history of prostate cancer (P = 0.025). Three of 4 male breast tumors with BRCA1 mutations (75%) were estrogen receptor positive. Whereas some studies have reported an 8%-0 rate of large BRCA2 genomic rearrangement in familial male breast cancer cases, we did not detect any such genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 or BRCA2 for our cohort.\n\nCONCLUSION: Despite this negative finding, our study, to the best of our knowledge, is one of the first to comprehensively screen for mutations, including large genomic rearrangement mutations, in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in men with breast cancer in the United States."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "12967658", "_score": 433.41083, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]", "Rad51 Recombinase [D051135:minor]", "Sequence Alignment [D016415:minor]", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid [D017386:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Binding Sites [D001665:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "DNA Repair [D004260:major]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Databases, Protein [D030562:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Protein Structure, Secondary [D017433:minor]"], "text": "Sequence fingerprints in BRCA2 and RAD51: implications for DNA repair and cancer.\n\n\nIn humans, the interactions between the breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, and the RAD51 recombinase are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), failure of which can predispose to cancer. The interactions occur through conserved BRC repeat motifs, encoded in BRCA2, binding directly to RAD51. Here, we describe full and partial BRCA2 homologues from a wide range of eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster and two Plasmodium species. The crystal structure of the human BRC4-RAD51 complex allows identification of residues that are important for protein-protein interaction, and defines interaction sequence fingerprints for the BRC repeat and for RAD51. These allow us to predict that most eukaryotic RAD51 and BRC repeat orthologues should be capable of mutual interactions. We find no evidence for the presence of BRC repeats in yeast, Archaea and bacteria, and their RAD51 orthologues do not fulfil the criteria for binding the BRC repeat. Similarly, human RAD51 paralogues, including RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, XRCC3 and DMC1, are not predicted to bind the BRC repeat. Conservation of the BRC repeat and RAD51 sequence fingerprints across a wide range of eukaryotic species substantiates the functional significance of the BRCA2-RAD51 interactions. The idea of multiple BRC repeats with binding specificity towards RAD51 leads us to suggest a possible model for the participation of BRCA2 in RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "12060539", "_score": 433.2824, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/ethnology [Q000208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]", "Spain [D013030:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/ethnology [Q000208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Portugal [D011174:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]"], "text": "[Analysis of mutations in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among patients with breast and ovarian cancer in northern Portugal and Galicia].\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: To detect mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by means of the protein truncation test (PTT) in a population in northern Portugal and Galicia with breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nDESIGN: Prospective study.\n\nSETTING: Patients in northern Portugal and Galicia with family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer.Patients.

In this study, we compared MD in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers from BRCA1/2 mutation-positive families and investigated the association between MD and BC among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers per type of mutation and tumor subtype.\n\nMETHODS: The study was carried out in 1039 female members of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive families followed at 16 Spanish Genetic Counseling Units. Participants' density was scored retrospectively from available mammograms by a single blinded radiologist using a 5-category scale (<10 %, 10-25 %, 25-50 %, 50-75 %, >75 %). In BC cases, we selected mammograms taken prior to diagnosis or from the contralateral breast, whereas, in non-cases, the last screening mammogram was evaluated. MD distribution in carriers and non-carriers was compared using ordinal logistic models, and the association between MD and BC in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was studied using logistic regression. Huber-White robust estimators of variance were used to take into account correlations between family members. A similar multinomial model was used to explore this association by BC subtype.\n\nRESULTS: We identified and scored mammograms from 341 BRCA1, 350 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 229 non-carriers. Compared to non-carriers, MD was significantly lower among BRCA2 mutation carriers (odds ratio (OR) =0.71; P-value=0.04), but not among BRCA1 carriers (OR=0.84; P-value=0.33). MD was associated with subsequent development BC (OR per category of MD=1.45; 95 % confidence interval=1.18-1.78, P-value<0.001), with no significant differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (P-value=0.48). Finally, no statistically significant differences were observed in the association of MD with specific BC subtypes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study, the largest to date on this issue, confirms that MD is an independent risk factor for all BC subtypes in either BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and should be considered a phenotype risk marker in this context."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "25348513", "_score": 431.88702, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Survival [D013534:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Prognosis [D011379:minor]"], "text": "Effects of BRCA1- and BRCA2-related mutations on ovarian and breast cancer survival: a meta-analysis.\n\n\nPURPOSE: To estimate the effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations on ovarian cancer and breast cancer survival.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies that evaluated the associations between BRCA mutations and ovarian or breast cancer survival.

Embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice homozygous for a hypomorphic mutation (Brca2(Tr2014)) within the 3' region of exon 11 in Brca2 [3], or a similar mutation (Brca2(Tr)) [4], proliferate poorly in culture and overexpress the tumour suppressor p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1). These MEFs have intact p53-dependent DNA damage G(1)-S [3] [4] and G(2)-M checkpoints [4], but are impaired in DNA double-strand break repair [3] and develop chromosome aberrations [4]. Here, we report that Brca2(Tr2014/Tr2014) MEFs frequently develop micronuclei. These abnormal DNA-containing bodies were formed through both loss of acentric chromosome fragments and by chromosome missegregation, which resulted in aneuploidy.

The introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the simultaneous testing of all genes implicated in breast cancer resulting in diagnostic labs offering large, comprehensive gene panels. However, some physicians prefer to only test for those genes in which established surveillance and treatment protocol exists. The NGS based BRCAplus test utilizes a custom tiled PCR based target enrichment design and bioinformatics pipeline coupled with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to identify mutations in the six high-risk genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, and STK11. Validation of the assay with 250 previously characterized samples resulted in 100% detection of 3,025 known variants and analytical specificity of 99.99%. Analysis of the clinical performance of the first 3,000 BRCAplus samples referred for testing revealed an average coverage greater than 9,000X per target base pair resulting in excellent specificity and the sensitivity to detect low level mosaicism and allele-drop out. The unique design of the assay enabled the detection of pathogenic mutations missed by previous testing. With the abundance of NGS diagnostic tests being released, it is essential that clinicians understand the advantages and limitations of different test designs."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9643283", "_score": 431.61896, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Age Factors [D000367:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Nuclear Family [D009679:major]", "Point Mutation [D017354:major]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:major]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genetic Markers [D005819:minor]", "Heterozygote Detection [D006580:minor]"], "text": "A population study of mutations and LOH at breast cancer gene loci in tumours from sister pairs: two recurrent mutations seem to account for all BRCA1/BRCA2 linked breast cancer in Iceland.\n\n\nThe majority of breast cancer in high risk families is believed to result from a mutation in either of two genes named BRCA1 and BRCA2. A germline defect in either gene is usually followed by chromosomal deletion of the normal allele in the tumour. In Iceland two recurrent mutations have been identified, 999del5 BRCA2 and G5193A BRCA1. In this study, randomly selected pairs of sisters diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 60 years or younger were analysed to evaluate the proportion of breast cancer resulting from BRCA1 and BRCA2. Genotypes and allele loss in tumour tissue from 42 sister pairs were compared using markers within and around the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Eleven sister pairs were highly suggestive of BRCA2 linkage, and no obvious BRCA1 linkage was seen. Screening for the G5193A BRCA1 and 999del5 BRCA2 mutations showed the 999del5 mutation in the 11 BRCA2 suggestive pairs plus three pairs less indicative of linkage, and the G5193A BRCA1 mutation in one pair. When known mutation carriers are removed from the group, no indication of further linkage to BRCA1 or BRCA2 is seen. The results of our studies suggest that a large proportion of familial breast cancer in Iceland is the result of the 999del5 BRCA2 mutation, and it is unlikely that BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations other than 999del5 and G5193A play a significant role in hereditary breast cancer in Iceland.

In this study, we evaluated 24 SNPs tagged to 14 candidate genes derived through a novel approach that analysed gene expression differences to prioritise candidate modifier genes for association studies.\n\nMETHODS: We successfully genotyped 24 SNPs in a cohort of up to 4,724 BRCA1 and 2,693 BRCA2 female mutation carriers from 15 study groups and assessed whether these variants were associated with risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\nRESULTS: SNPs in five of the 14 candidate genes showed evidence of association with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers (P < 0.05). Notably, the minor alleles of two SNPs (rs7166081 and rs3825977) in high linkage disequilibrium (r\u00b2 = 0.77), located at the SMAD3 locus (15q22), were each associated with increased breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers (relative risk = 1.25, 95% confidence interval = 1.07 to 1.45, P(trend) = 0.004; and relative risk = 1.20, 95% confidence interval = 1.03 to 1.40, P(trend) = 0.018).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the SMAD3 gene, which encodes a key regulatory protein in the transforming growth factor beta signalling pathway and is known to interact directly with BRCA2, may contribute to increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers. This finding suggests that genes with expression associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status are enriched for the presence of common genetic modifiers of breast cancer risk in these populations."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "14973102", "_score": 430.58807, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]", "Prevalence [D015995:minor]", "Risk Assessment [D018570:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/ethnology [Q000208:major]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "China [D002681:minor]/ethnology [Q000208:minor]", "Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in women from Shanghai China.\n\n\nLittle is known about the frequency of germ-line mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Asian populations.

Study subjects totaled 1306, and included 645 women with breast cancer, 342 women with benign breast disease, and 319 unaffected controls, born between 1924 and 1958, selected from women enrolled in a randomized trial of Breast Self-Examination in Shanghai, China.

Data were analyzed with respect to age at diagnosis, and family history of breast and ovarian cancer. The prevalence of known disease-associated mutations in women with breast cancer was 1.1% each, for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Among breast cancer cases with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, 8.1% and 2.7% carried likely BRCA1 and BRCA2 disease-associated mutations, respectively.

Because BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes participate in the DNA repair pathway, we have performed an immunohistochemical study with markers related to this pathway to establish the profile of the three groups.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We have studied two tissue microarrays that include 103 familial and 104 sporadic breast tumors, with a panel of DNA repair markers including ATM, CHEK2, RAD51, RAD50, XRCC3, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen.\n\nRESULTS: We found more frequent expression of CHEK2 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors than in non-BRCA1/2 and sporadic tumors. We found absence of nuclear expression and presence of cytoplasmic expression of RAD51 in BRCA2 tumors that differentiate them from other familial tumors. We validated these results with a new series of patient cases. The final study with 253 familial patient cases (74 BRCA1, 71 BRCA2, 108 non-BRCA1/2), and 288 sporadic patient cases, has allowed us to confirm our preliminary results. Because BRCA2 tumors present a specific immunohistochemical profile for RAD51 and CHEK2 markers that is different from non-BRCA1/2 tumors, we have built a multivariate model with these markers that distinguish both tumors with an estimated probability of at least 76%.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results suggest that BRCA2 tumors demonstrate more cytoplasmic and less nuclear RAD51 staining, and increased CHEK2 staining.

We previously identified significant associations in genetic variants in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. Here, we investigate additional IGF signaling genes as risk modifiers for breast cancer development in BRCA carriers.\n\nMETHODS: A cohort of 1,019 BRCA1 and 500 BRCA2 mutation carriers were genotyped for 99 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 13 genes. Proportional hazards regression was used to model time from birth to diagnosis of breast cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers separately. For linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks with multiple SNPs, an additive genetic model was used. For an SNP analysis, no additivity assumptions were made.\n\nRESULTS: Significant associations were found between risk of breast cancer and LD blocks in IGF2 for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (global P values of 0.009 for BRCA1 and 0.007 for BRCA2), HTRA1 for BRCA1 carriers (global P value of 0.005), and MMP3 for BRCA2 carriers (global P = 0.0000007 for BRCA2).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified significant associations of genetic variants involved in IGF signaling.

However, a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene, such as p53, BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM, has been determined to be one mechanism of breast carcinogenesis. It has been established that inherited mutations in p53, BRCA1, and BRCA2 significantly contribute to breast cancer risk, although the importance of an inherited ATM mutation is controversial. Sporadic mutations in p53 are also common in breast cancer cells. The precise deficiencies that result from these genetic mutations have yet to be fully described. Although the functions of these genes are different, they are all involved in the maintenance of genomic stability after DNA damage.

Mutation carriers frequently have a positive family history of breast and ovarian cancer, are often diagnosed at a young age, and may have a higher incidence of double or multiple primary breast tumours than breast cancer patients in general.\n\nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence and spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in young Danish patients affected with bilateral or multifocal breast cancer and to determine the relationship of mutation status to family history of cancer.\n\nSUBJECTS: From the files of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG), we selected 119 breast cancer patients diagnosed before the age of 46 years with either bilateral (n=59) or multifocal (n=61) disease.\n\nMETHODS: DNA from the subjects was screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations using single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and the protein truncation test (PTT). Observed and expected cancer incidence in first degree relatives of the patients was estimated using data from the Danish Cancer Registry.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty four mutation carriers were identified (20%), of whom 13 had a BRCA1 mutation and 11 carried a BRCA2 mutation. Two mutations in BRCA1 were found repeatedly in the material and accounted for seven of the 24 (29%) mutation carriers. The mutation frequency was about equal in patients with bilateral (22%) and multifocal breast cancer (18%). The incidence of breast and ovarian cancer was greatly increased in first degree relatives of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, but to a much lesser degree in relatives of non-carriers. An increased risk of cancer was also noted in brothers of non-carriers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A relatively broad spectrum of germline mutations was observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and most of the mutations are present in other populations. Our results indicate that a diagnosis of bilateral and multifocal breast cancer is predictive of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, particularly when combined with information on the patients' age at diagnosis and family history of breast/ovarian cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10498873", "_score": 427.91882, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "DNA Damage [D004249:minor]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:major]", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:minor]", "Lymphatic Metastasis [D008207:minor]", "Menopause [D008593:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Microsatellite Repeats [D018895:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mitotic Index [D008940:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "RNA, Messenger [D012333:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "RNA, Neoplasm [D012334:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Receptors, Estrogen [D011960:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]", "Receptors, Progesterone [D011980:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction [D020133:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast [D018270:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]", "Cell Nucleus [D002467:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 [D002882:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]"], "text": "Overexpression of BRCA2 gene in sporadic breast tumours.\n\n\nThe breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues as an 11-kb mRNA transcript that encodes a 3418-amino acid protein involved in the response to DNA damage. To obtain better a molecular characterization of BRCA2 expression in sporadic breast cancer, we quantified BRCA2 mRNA by means of RT - PCR in a large series of human primary breast tumours. BRCA2 expression showed wide variations in tumour tissues, being underexpressed in 14/127 (11%) and overexpressed in 25/127 (20%). BRCA2 overexpression (but not underexpression) correlated significantly with Scarff, Bloom and Richardson (SBR) histopathological grade III (P=0.007) and was mainly attributed to nuclear polymorphism (P=0.005) and mitotic index (P=0.048), suggesting that the BRCA2 gene contributes to the proliferation rate in breast tumours. BRCA2 status (under and/or overexpression versus normal expression) was not associated with subsequent relapse and with significantly shorter disease-free survival. The observed disruption of BRCA2 expression is not due to allelic loss, because the latter did not correlate with altered BRCA2 mRNA expression in our tumour series.

We reviewed the medical literature on the clinico-pathological features of breast cancer associated with the major breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1-associated breast cancers are more frequently ductal invasive, high-grade carcinomas with an important lymphocytic infiltration. They are aneuploid, estrogen and progesterone receptors negative, and p53 positive. BRCA2-related breast cancers tend to be higher-grade tumors than are non-hereditary cases, although this association is less strong then for BRCA1 cases. These tumors exhibit substantially less tubule formation, but mitotic count and cellular pleomorphism do not differ significantly from those of sporadic cases. The overall pattern of the identified pathological characteristics suggests a carcinogenic pathway in BRCA1- and BRCA2-related breast cancers different from that found in sporadic cases.

It is of interest that frameshift mutation 8984delG was the most frequent, since it was detected in 5 patients from three different families.

Protein-truncating mutations of BRCA2 are usually deleterious and increase the risk of breast cancer up to 80% over a lifetime. A few missense mutations in BRCA2 are believed to have a similarly high penetrance, apart from more common neutral polymorphisms. It is often difficult to classify a particular sequence variant as a mutation or a polymorphism. For a deleterious variant, one would expect a greater allele frequency in breast cancer cases than in ethnic-matched controls. In contrast, neutral polymorphic variants should be equally frequent in the two groups.\n\nMETHODS: We genotyped 3,241 cases of breast cancer diagnosed at under 51 years of age, unselected for family history, from 18 hospitals throughout Poland and 2,791 ethnic-matched controls for a single BRCA2 C5972T variant.\n\nRESULTS: The variant was present in approximately 6% of the Polish population. In the study, 13 women (11 cases and two controls (OR = 4.7; p = 0.02)) were homozygous for the variant allele. The overall odds ratio for breast cancer in women with a single copy of the BRCA2 C5972T variant was 1.1 (p = 0.7); however, the effect was significant for patients diagnosed at or before age 40 (OR = 1.4; p = 0.04). We reviewed the association between the BRCA2 variant in different histologic subgroups and found the effect most pronounced in women who had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with micro-invasion (OR = 2.8; p < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The BRCA2 C5972T allele is a common variant in Poland that increases the risk of DCIS with micro-invasion.

However, we postulated that in high-risk families, such as those seen in clinical genetics centres, the risk of breast cancer might be influenced not only by the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation but also by modifier genes. One manifestation of this would be the presence of phenocopies in BRCA1/BRCA2 kindreds.\n\nMETHODS: 277 families with pathogenic BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were reviewed and 28 breast cancer phenocopies identified.

Hazard ratios (HRs) for CBC associated with tamoxifen use were estimated using Cox regression, adjusting for year and age of diagnosis, country, and bilateral oophorectomy and censoring at contralateral mastectomy, death, or loss to follow-up.\n\nRESULTS: Of 1,583 BRCA1 and 881 BRCA2 mutation carriers, 383 (24%) and 454 (52%), respectively, took tamoxifen after first BC diagnosis.

Tamoxifen protects against contralateral breast cancer in the general population, but whether it protects against contralateral breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers is not known.\n\nMETHODS: We compared 209 women with bilateral breast cancer and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (bilateral-disease cases), with 384 women with unilateral disease and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (controls) in a matched case-control study. Age and age at diagnosis of breast cancer (range 24-74 years) were much the same in bilateral-disease cases and controls, and both groups had been followed up for the same time for a second primary breast cancer. History of tamoxifen use for first breast cancer was obtained by interview, or by self-administered questionnaire.\n\nFINDINGS: The multivariate odds ratio for contralateral breast cancer associated with tamoxifen use was 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.89). Tamoxifen protected against contralateral breast cancer for carriers of BRCA1 mutations (odds ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.74) and for those with BRCA2 mutations (0.63, 0.20-1.50). In women who used tamoxifen for 2-4 years, the risk of contralateral breast cancer was reduced by 75%.

Ovarian cancers due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations cannot usually be distinguished from their non-hereditary counterparts on morphological grounds, but micro-array data suggest that differences do exist. Prognostic studies have shown that breast cancer in a BRCA1 mutation carrier is likely to have a similar, or worse, outcome than that occurring in a BRCA2- or non-carrier of the same age. By contrast, most studies indicate that women developing a BRCA1/2-related ovarian cancer have an improved survival compared with non-carriers, particularly if they receive platinum-based therapy. In support of this, in vitro chemo-sensitivity studies have found that human cells lacking BRCA1 may be particularly sensitive to cisplatinum and to other drugs that cause double-strand breaks in DNA. Nevertheless, in breast cancer, little is known regarding clinically important differences in response to chemotherapy between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, and between different chemotherapeutic regimens within existing series of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

To investigate LOH of BRCA1 (17q21) and BRCA2 (13-q12-13) in sporadic breast cancer, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based fluorescent DNA technology for detection of microsatellite polymorphisms was applied. A total of 137 breast cancer and 15 benign breast specimens with matched normal tissue were examined. Fluorescent-labelled PCR products were analysed in an automated DNA sequencer (ALFTM Pharmacia). Losses at both loci were correlated with different histological types, age, tumour size, lymph node status, grading and steroid hormone receptor expression, [SHR: oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR)]. For BRCA1 (D17S855, THRA1, D17S579) losses could be detected in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC; n = 108) in 32-38%, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC; n = 19) in 21-42% depending on the marker applied, but not in benign breast tumours (n = 15).

Two recent structures of BRCA2 domains have revealed that it may serve as a critical mediator of DNA repair through direct interactions with Rad51, the eukaryotic homolog of RecA, and with single-stranded DNA. Before the structures were determined, little was known about the structural basis of BRCA2 interactions with the Rad51 pathway of DNA repair. Taken together, the structures provide striking insights into the role of BRCA2 in double-strand DNA break repair and suggest a direct role for BRCA2 in homologous recombination that was not evident from earlier studies."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20927582", "_score": 424.03427, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Models, Genetic [D008957:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins [D025521:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "United States [D014481:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Lymphatic Metastasis [D008207:minor]"], "text": "Mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in male breast cancer cases from the United States.\n\n\nMale breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon disease with a frequency of approximately one in 1000.

Our objectives are to determine the frequency of pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2 in MBC cases and to investigate the correlations between mutation status and cancer phenotypes. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer. The difference in BRCA2-mutation frequencies between cases with and without family history of breast cancer was not statistically significant (P = 0.145), suggesting that family history is not a strong predictor of carrying a mutation in males. We observed a highly significant association of carrying a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation with high tumor grade (P < 0.001) and a weak association with positive lymph nodes (P < 0.02).

The allele frequency of the KRAS-variant was found to be increased among patients with breast cancer from BRCA1, but not BRCA2 or non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families as compared to controls. As BRCA1 carriers mostly develop ER-negative breast cancers, we also examined the variant allele frequency among indexes from non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families with ER-negative breast cancer. The prevalence of the KRAS-variant was, however, not significantly increased as compared to controls, suggesting that the variant allele not just simply associates with ER-negative breast cancer. Subsequent expansion of the number of BRCA1 carriers with breast cancer by including other family members in addition to the index cases resulted in loss of significance for the association between the variant allele and mutant BRCA1 breast cancer. In this same cohort, the KRAS-variant did not appear to modify breast cancer risk for BRCA1 carriers.

In this study we assessed the sensitivity to standard first-line chemotherapy of metastatic BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, compared with sporadic breast cancer patients.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: From the Family Cancer Clinic database, we selected 93 BRCA1- and 28 BRCA2-associated breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease before January 1, 2007. Objective response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) after start of first-line chemotherapy were compared with those of sporadic patients, matched for year of birth, age at diagnosis of primary breast cancer, and year of detection of metastatic disease.\n\nRESULTS: The chemotherapy regimens most frequently used were anthracycline-based (n = 147) and cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF)/CMF like (n = 68). As compared to sporadic patients, BRCA2-associated patients had a significantly higher OR (89% v 50%; P = .001), a longer PFS (hazard ratio multivariate [HR(mult)] 0.64; P = .04) and a prolonged OS (HR(mult), 0.53; P = .005) after start of first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. For BRCA1-associated patients, a nonsignificant trend for an increased OR (66% v 50%; P = .07), and a longer PFS (HR(mult), 0.79; P = .14) after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer was observed, but not for OS.\n\nCONCLUSION: BRCA2-associated breast cancer is more sensitive to standard first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in comparison with sporadic breast cancer, especially to anthracyclines.

They exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and the remaining copy of BRCA2 has a 6174delT mutation, which causes a premature C-terminal truncation that removes the domains for DNA repair and the nuclear localization signals. The DNA repair protein RAD51, which interacts with BRCA2, exhibits impaired nuclear translocation in CAPAN-1. It has been speculated that RAD51 may require BRCA2 for nuclear entry and that C-terminally truncated BRCA2 may retain RAD51 in the cytoplasm. This may cause heterozygous individuals to exhibit deficient DNA repair and cell viability comparable to individuals with LOH or biallelic BRCA2 mutations. We simulated a heterozygous condition by using stably transfected CAPAN-1 cells with wild-type BRCA2. Fusion of a nuclear localization signal to RAD51 did not increase its ability to independently enter the nuclei of CAPAN-1 cells. Furthermore, restoration of functional BRCA2 did not significantly improve DNA repair, nor did it reestablish cell viability in CAPAN-1 cells.

Here, we explore the impact of DNA copy-number changes in BRCA2 tumors with respect to phenotype and clinical staging of the disease.\n\nMETHODS: Breast tumors (n = 33) derived from BRCA2 999del5 mutation carriers were examined in terms of copy-number changes with high-resolution aCGH (array comparative genomic hybridization) containing 385 thousand probes (about one for each 7 kbp) and expression of phenotypic markers on TMAs (tissue microarrays). The data were examined with respect to clinical parameters including TNM staging, histologic grade, S phase, and ploidy.\n\nRESULTS: Tumors from BRCA2 carriers of luminal and basal/triple-negative phenotypes (TNPs) differ with respect to patterns of DNA copy-number changes. The basal/TNP subtype was characterized by lack of pRb (RB1) coupled with high/intense expression of p16 (CDKN2A) gene products. We found increased proportions of Ki-67-positive cells to be significantly associated with loss of the wild-type (wt) BRCA2 allele in luminal types, whereas BRCA2wt loss was less frequent in BRCA2 tumors displaying basal/TNP phenotypes. Furthermore, we show that deletions at 13q13.1, involving the BRCA2wt allele, represents a part of a larger network of co-occurring genetic changes, including deletions at 6q22.32-q22.33, 11q14.2-q24.1, and gains at 17q24.1. Importantly, copy-number changes at these BRCA2-linked networking regions coincide with those associated with advanced progression, involving the capacity to metastasize to the nodes or more-distant sites at diagnosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results presented here demonstrate divergent paths of tumor evolution in BRCA2 carriers and that deletion of the wild-type BRCA2 allele, together with co-occurring changes at 6 q, 11 q, and 17 q, are important events in progression toward advanced disease."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11890985", "_score": 422.00836, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Diseases in Twins [D004200:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]"], "text": "Hereditary breast cancer associated with a germline BRCA2 mutation in identical female twins with similar disease expression.\n\n\nThe relative contribution of heritable and nonheritable factors to disease expression in BRCA2 mutation carriers is largely unknown.

Rad51 and FancD2 form colocalizing subnuclear foci independently of each other. Furthermore, we created a conditional BRCA2 truncating mutation lacking the C-terminal conserved domain (CTD) (brca2DeltaCTD), and disrupted the FANCC gene in this background. The fancc/brca2DeltaCTD double mutant revealed an epistatic relationship between FANCC and BRCA2 CTD in terms of x-ray sensitivity. In contrast, levels of cisplatin sensitivity and mitomycin C-induced chromosomal aberrations were increased in fancc/brca2DeltaCTD cells relative to either single mutant. Taken together, these results indicate that FA proteins work together with BRCA2/Rad51-mediated homologous recombination in double strand break repair, whereas the FA pathway plays a role that is independent of the CTD of BRCA2 in interstrand cross-link repair.

The present study was aimed to analyze the sequence variations in BRCA2 gene in a case control manner in ethnically pure Kashmiri population using PCR. Sequencing of BRCA2 exons revealed the presence of five sequence variations, four of which present in exon 11 alone were somatic and one was germline located in the U-terminal region (UTR) of exon 2. Out of these, the two somatic mutations comprised of substitutions, one representing a missense mutation leading to an amino-acid substitution at codon 991 and the other was a silent mutation at codon 1131, whereas the other two mutations located in exon 11 represented a loss of polymorphism. Codons for amino acid position 846 and 868 were demonstrated to be heterozygous polymorphic variants in 66% of the normal breast tissue samples, whereas the heterozygous polymorphic variant codons at the two loci were replaced by a homozygous genotype in associated tumor tissue in 88% of cases.

We combined mutational screening with the study of germ-line allele transcript levels and of tumor-associated losses of heterozygosity. Screening by protein truncation test and single-strand conformational polymorphism assay, followed by sequencing, revealed 4 pathogenetic mutations (4 of 25 = 16%; 95% confidence interval, 5-37%), 1 in BRCA1 and 3 in BRCA2, including mutations recurring in Central Italy (BRCA1 3345delAG and BRCA2 6696delTC). The a priori probability of carrying a mutation, estimated using BRCAPRO software, showed a good agreement between expected and observed mutations (14% versus 16%). A 7-fold association between germ-line mutations and family history of breast-ovarian cancer emerged. To investigate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 status and clinicopathological characteristics, we analyzed the histopathological and immunophenotypic parameters of the tumors. A significant association emerged between mutation carrier status and high histological grade (P = 0.02). Furthermore, one BRCA2 carrier was affected with Paget's disease, an extremely rare male breast cancer histotype. Overall, BRCA1/2 mutations were observed to be strongly associated with positive c-erbB-2 immunostaining (P = 0.004). To evaluate germ-line allele expression, we used primer extension assays targeting frequent BRCA1 and BRCA2 polymorphisms. A BRCA2 allele transcript imbalance was found in one of four heterozygotes tested, all of them negative for germ-line mutations. BRCA1 transcript imbalances were not detected in nine heterozygotes analyzed. Losses of heterozygosity at one or more of nine loci in the BRCA2 region were found in 8 of 22 tumors tested. Interestingly, a case that was negative for BRCA1/BRCA2 germ-line mutations and that had a priori mutation probability <10% showed loss of heterozygosity at all three of the intragenic BRCA2 markers analyzed, which could be related to a somatic involvement of BRCA2. No losses of heterozygosity were detected at BRCA1. In conclusion, constitutional BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations accounted for 16% of the male breast cancer cases in this area of Central Italy. The detection of a BRCA2 germ-line transcript imbalance and of a somatic loss of BRCA2 among the cases that resulted negative for germ-line mutations suggests a role of this gene more relevant than indicated by conventional mutational analysis. A distinct pattern of characteristics indicative of aggressive behavior, including high-grade and c-erbB-2 expression, was evident in tumors from germ-line BRCA2 mutation carriers. This suggests that phenotypic characteristics may contribute to the identification of hereditary BRCA2-related male breast cancers and that these tumors might share a unique molecular pathway of cancer progression."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "16448223", "_score": 420.7107, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast [D001940:minor]/cytology [Q000166:major]", "Genetic Vectors [D005822:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Iceland [D007055:minor]", "Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]", "Karyotyping [D007621:minor]", "Keratins [D007633:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Oncogenes [D009857:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Retroviridae [D012190:minor]", "Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:major]", "Chromosomal Instability [D043171:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Cytogenetic Analysis [D020732:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "DNA Primers [D017931:minor]", "Epithelial Cells [D004847:minor]/cytology [Q000166:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Establishment of three human breast epithelial cell lines derived from carriers of the 999del5 BRCA2 Icelandic founder mutation.\n\n\nGerm line mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for a large proportion of inherited breast and ovarian cancer.

Germline mutations in PALB2 have been identified in approximately 1% of familial breast cancer and 3-4% of familial pancreatic cancer. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of PALB2 mutations in a population of BRCA1/BRCA2 negative breast cancer patients selected from either a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer.\n\nMETHODS: 132 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast/ovarian cancer families with at least one pancreatic cancer case were included in the study. PALB2 mutational analysis was performed by direct sequencing of all coding exons and intron/exon boundaries, as well as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification.\n\nRESULTS: Two PALB2 truncating mutations, the c.1653T>A (p.Tyr551Stop) previously reported, and c.3362del (p.Gly1121ValfsX3) which is a novel frameshift mutation, were identified. Moreover, several PALB2 variants were detected; some of them were predicted as pathological by bioinformatic analysis. Considering truncating mutations, the prevalence rate of our population of BRCA1/2-negative breast cancer patients with pancreatic cancer is 1.5%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate of PALB2 mutations in non-BRCA1/BRCA2 breast/ovarian cancer families, selected from either a personal or family pancreatic cancer history, is similar to that previously described for unselected breast/ovarian cancer families.

Twelve of 15 tumors from carriers showed absent protein expression as opposed to 3 of 76 tumors from noncarriers (P < 0.001).

The human BRCA2-deficient human cell line Capan-1, whilst being sensitive to ionizing radiation, is also sensitive to the alkylating agent methymethanesulfonate. The major lesions induced by this agent are methylated bases which are removed primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway.

However, difficulties due to genetic heterogeneity, reduced penetrance and perhaps gene mutation frequency complicate ongoing efforts to identify additional susceptibility genes. Therefore, multiple approaches are being used to identify additional high and low penetrance genes. Families with three or more breast cancer cases are being used in traditional linkage studies, which are expected to yield only moderate or high penetrance susceptibility genes. Breast cancer case-control studies are being used to look for genetic variants or polymorphisms that confer an increased risk of breast cancer in a wide variety of cellular pathways, ranging from the detoxification of environmental carcinogens to steroid hormone metabolism, DNA damage repair and immune surveillance, an approach useful primarily to identify low penetrance susceptibililty genes. However, neither approach has yielded convincing results to date. A third approach, using BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers to identify genes that are associated with modification of breast cancer risk has met with some limited success, perhaps because effects on breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are more readily detected in smaller studies, given the much higher number of events in these cohorts at very high risk of breast cancer. Clearly, hereditary breast cancer susceptibility is a complex phenomenon, in which multiple genes may play a role.

The biological and genetic profiles of the xenograft were compared with that of the patient's tumour using histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), BRCA2 sequencing, comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), and qRT-PCR. Tumour response to standard chemotherapies was evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Histological profile identified the tumour as a basal-like triple-negative breast cancer. Targeted BRCA2 DNA sequencing of the xenograft showed the presence of the mutation previously identified in the carrier. Comparative genomic hybridisation array profiles of the primary tumour and the xenograft revealed a high number of similar genetic alterations. The therapeutic assessment of the xenograft showed sensitivity to anthracyclin-based chemotherapy and resistance to docetaxel. The xenograft was also highly sensitive to radiotherapy and cisplatin-based treatments.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study describes a new human breast cancer xenograft obtained from a BRCA2-mutated patient.

Assuring reliability of information about these mutations is increasingly important to the health care community; mutation testing is becoming more widespread. We describe a methodology for assessing such information.\n\nMETHODS: Our approach integrates four interdependent epidemiologic parameters: (1) the probability of developing breast cancer, (2) the proportion of breast cancer cases with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, (3) the proportion of women that carries a mutation, and (4) the proportion of women with a mutation that develops cancer. We assess the plausibility of estimates of these parameters from published reports and commonly accessed information sources.\n\nRESULTS: Assuming a fixed probability of developing breast cancer, the following estimates for the other three epidemiologic parameters are derived for women by age 70: 1% to 2% of all breast cancer cases are associated with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation; 1 in 300 to 1 in 465 women carry a mutation; and 35 to 65% of mutation carriers develop breast cancer. Within these ranges, however, only selected combinations are plausible. The proportion of mutation-related breast cancer is lower than listed in some common information sources (1 to 2% vs 6%). Also, penetrance is somewhat lower and the carrier rate somewhat higher.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The four epidemiologic parameters can be integrated to test their plausibility.

We screened the complete coding region of both genes in 451 individuals from 349 Belgian families referred to a family cancer clinic and identified 49 families with a BRCA1 and 26 families with a BRCA2 mutation.

In combination with a family history, an early average age of female breast cancer diagnosis (P<0.001), and the presence of a relative with ovarian cancer (P<0.0001) or multiple primary breast cancers (P=0.002), increased the chance for finding a mutation. Male breast cancer was indicative of a BRCA2 mutation segregating in the family (P=0.002).

Furthermore, other breast cancer genes generally are not evaluated.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and types of undetected cancer-predisposing mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN among patients with breast cancer from high-risk families with negative (wild-type) genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2002-2005, probands from 300 US families with 4 or more cases of breast or ovarian cancer but with negative (wild-type) commercial genetic test results for BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened by multiple DNA-based and RNA-based methods to detect genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and germline mutations of all classes in CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Previously undetected germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, TP53, and PTEN that predispose to breast cancer; frequencies of these mutations among families with negative genetic test results.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 300 probands, 52 (17%) carried previously undetected mutations, including 35 (12%) with genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 or BRCA2, 14 (5%) with CHEK2 mutations, and 3 (1%) with TP53 mutations. At BRCA1 and BRCA2, 22 different genomic rearrangements were found, of sizes less than 1 kb to greater than 170 kb; of these, 14 were not previously described and all were individually rare. At CHEK2, a novel 5.6-kb genomic deletion was discovered in 2 families of Czechoslovakian ancestry. This deletion was found in 8 of 631 (1.3%) patients with breast cancer and in none of 367 healthy controls in the Czech and Slovak Republics. For all rearrangements, exact genomic breakpoints were determined and diagnostic primers validated. The 3 families with TP53 mutations included cases of childhood sarcoma or brain tumors in addition to multiple cases of breast cancer.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The mutational spectra of BRCA1 and BRCA2 include many high-penetrance, individually rare genomic rearrangements. Among patients with breast cancer and severe family histories of cancer who test negative (wild type) for BRCA1 and BRCA2, approximately 12% can be expected to carry a large genomic deletion or duplication in one of these genes, and approximately 5% can be expected to carry a mutation in CHEK2 or TP53.

Gene analysis was performed by dye primer sequencing for the entire coding regions of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Because a personal and family history of ovarian cancer are known to be significantly associated with mutations, women with either were excluded from analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were identified in 85 of 440 women (19%) with breast cancer under 45. Mutations were identified in 73 of 276 women (26%) with a first degree family history of breast cancer compared to 12 of 164 without (7%) (P < .0001). When results were analyzed by the age of diagnosis in first degree relatives, mutations were identified in 56 of 185 women (30%) with at least one first degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed before age 50 compared with 17 of 91 women (19%), where the first degree family history of breast cancer was at or over age 50 (P = .042).\n\nCONCLUSION: Among women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 45, a first-degree relative diagnosed with the disease under age 50 is an indicator of a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 even in the absence of a family history of ovarian cancer. Therefore, women diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer should be asked about the age of onset in any first-degree relative diagnosed with the disease, as well as about any family history of ovarian cancer. Mutations in BRCA2 account for a substantial proportion of hereditary breast cancer. Therefore, studies that are limited to BRCA1 or that do not analyze by age of onset of breast cancer in relatives may underestimate the contribution of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 to women with early onset breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "16049805", "_score": 419.11612, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adolescent [D000293:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]/statistics & numerical data [Q000706:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Incidence [D015994:minor]", "Menarche [D008572:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Menstruation [D008598:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Adult [D000328:minor]", "Age Factors [D000367:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "Child [D002648:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Age at menarche and the risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nAge at menarche is a strong and consistent predictor of breast cancer risk in the general population, but has not been well studied in women with a family history of breast cancer.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of heterozygosity is found in almost all BRCA1 and BRCA2 carcinomas, respectively. Both genotypes have a low frequency of HER2 expression/amplification. In addition, comparative genomic hybridization and array expression studies have revealed differences in chromosomal gains and losses as well as expression patterns between genotypes. Several studies have shown that hereditary carcinomas that are not attributable to BRCA1/2 mutations are heterogeneous and have phenotypic similarities to BRCA2 tumors. A small group of cases are secondary to mutations in other breast cancer susceptibility genes, such as p53, PTEN or CDH1. As a result of the low frequency of breast carcinomas attributable to mutations in these genes, it is very difficult to establish a specific phenotype for each genotype, other than the association of lobular carcinomas with CDH1 germline mutations.

To examine the potential role of this mutation in prostate cancer we analyzed prostate cancer cases from 16 BRCA2 families and all available samples from individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer in Iceland over a period of 1 year.

However, risk estimates range from 20 to 80%, suggesting the presence of genetic and/or environmental risk modifiers. Based on extensive in vivo and in vitro studies, one important pathway for breast cancer pathogenesis may be the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, which regulates both cellular proliferation and apoptosis. BRCA1 has been shown to directly interact with IGF signaling such that variants in this pathway may modify risk of cancer in women carrying BRCA mutations. In this study, we investigate the association of variants in genes involved in IGF signaling and risk of breast cancer in women who carry deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\nMETHODS: A cohort of 1,665 adult, female mutation carriers, including 1,122 BRCA1 carriers (433 cases) and 543 BRCA2 carriers (238 cases) were genotyped for SNPs in IGF1, IGF1 receptor (IGF1R), IGF1 binding protein (IGFBP1, IGFBP2, IGFBP5), and IGF receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model time from birth to diagnosis of breast cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers separately. For linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks with multiple SNPs, an additive genetic model was assumed; and for single SNP analyses, no additivity assumptions were made.\n\nRESULTS: Among BRCA1 carriers, significant associations were found between risk of breast cancer and LD blocks in IGF1R (global P = 0.011 for LD block 2 and global P = 0.012 for LD block 11). Among BRCA2 carriers, an LD block in IGFBP2 (global P = 0.0145) was found to be associated with the time to breast cancer diagnosis. No significant LD block associations were found for the other investigated genes among BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the role of genetic variation in IGF signaling and breast cancer risk in women carrying deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. We identified significant associations in variants in IGF1R and IRS1 in BRCA1 carriers and in IGFBP2 in BRCA2 carriers.

Exon trapping experiments and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that the BRCA2 mutation results in skipping of exon 7, thereby introducing a frameshift and a premature stop codon. We therefore classify the mutation as disease causing.

Women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were matched to control subjects by year of birth, country of residence, mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2), and history of ovarian cancer. All study subjects completed a questionnaire about oral contraceptive use. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived by conditional logistic regression.

For BRCA1 mutation carriers, ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with a modestly increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.40). However, compared with BRCA1 mutation carriers who never used oral contraceptives, those who used oral contraceptives for at least 5 years had an increased risk of breast cancer (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.60), as did those who used oral contraceptives before age 30 (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.52), those who were diagnosed with breast cancer before age 40 (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.72), and those who first used oral contraceptives before 1975 (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.17 to 1.75).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, women who first used oral contraceptives before 1975, who used them before age 30, or who used them for 5 or more years may have an increased risk of early-onset breast cancer.

We aimed to compare the histological features of breast cancer in women carrying mutations in the susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 with controls unselected for family history.\n\nMETHODS: The morphological characteristics of specimens from 440 patients with familial breast cancer, including 118 in carriers of BRCA1 mutations and 78 in carriers of BRCA2 mutations, were compared with those from 547 age-matched controls, unselected for family history, by seven pathologists.\n\nFINDINGS: Cancers in carriers of BRCA1 (p < 0.0001) and BRCA2 mutations (p = 0.04) were, on average, of a higher overall grade than in controls. For example, the proportions in grade 3 were 66% of 139, 41% of 58 and 36% of 368 specimens, respectively. However, when the three grade indices were considered independently, breast cancers in BRCA1-mutation carriers showed more pleomorphism (p = 0.006), a higher mitotic count (p < 0.0001), and less tubule formation than controls (p = 0.006), whereas cancers in BRCA2-mutation carriers showed less tubule formation (p = 0.003), but no difference in pleomorphism or mitotic count. The occurrence of invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma was not significantly different between carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and controls. Medullary or atypical medullary carcinoma was, however, found more often in BRCA1 (13%, p < 0.0001) than in BRCA2-mutation carriers (3%) or controls (2%). Tubular carcinoma was less common in BRCA2-mutation carriers. The few mucoid carcinomas were all in familial cases. Carriers of BRCA1 mutations showed less ductal carcinoma in situ around the invasive lesion than controls (41 vs 56%, p = 0.001). Lobular carcinoma in situ was less common in familial cancers (p = 0.013), but differences were not significant for BRCA1-mutations or BRCA2-mutation carriers, separately.\n\nINTERPRETATION: The histology of breast cancers in predisposed women differs from that in sporadic cases, and there are differences between breast cancers in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The findings suggest that breast cancer due to BRCA1, has a different natural history to BRCA2 or apparently sporadic disease, which may have implications for screening and management."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20104584", "_score": 416.90747, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Gene Frequency [D005787:minor]", "Genetic Variation [D014644:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Mutation, Missense [D020125:minor]", "Protein Binding [D011485:minor]", "Alleles [D000483:minor]", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins [D051017:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:minor]"], "text": "Characterization of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations and variants of unknown clinical significance in unilateral and bilateral breast cancer: the WECARE study.\n\n\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 screening in women at high-risk of breast cancer results in the identification of both unambiguously defined deleterious mutations and sequence variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS).

Currently, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes explain less than 25% of the familial clustering of breast cancer, and additional susceptibility genes are suspected. The BCCIP gene plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation and could be involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The BCCIP protein binds in mammalian cells to the longest conserved region of the BRCA2 protein and is required for BRCA2 stability and function, making a critical contribution to the function of BRCA2 in mediating homologous recombination. Variants in the BCCIP gene could affect the BRCA2 functionality and be associated to the familial breast/ovarian carcinogenesis. Therefore, BCCIP gene is a potential candidate for being involved in heritable cancer susceptibility.\n\nMETHODS: We have screened the entire coding region and splice junctions of BCCIP in affected index cases from 215 Spanish breast/ovarian cancer families for germ line defects, using direct sequencing.\n\nRESULTS: Mutation analysis revealed 3 different intronic sequence changes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the in silico and in vitro RNA analyses of these sequence alterations, none of them were predicted to be pathogenic or associated with cancer susceptibility.

Accurate estimation of breast cancer risk is crucial for appropriate counselling regarding risk management. The aim of this study is to prospectively assess whether breast cancer risk for mutation negative women from families segregating BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations is greater than for women in the general population. Eligible women were 722 first-, second- and third-degree relatives of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier from 224 mutation positive (128 BRCA1, 96 BRCA2) families, had no personal cancer history at baseline, and had been tested and found not to carry the family-specific mutation. Self-reported family history of cancer, preventive interventions and verified cancer diagnoses were collected at baseline, and every 3 years thereafter. Median follow-up was 6.1 years (range 0.1-12.4 years). Time at risk of breast cancer was censored at cancer diagnosis or risk-reducing surgery. Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated by comparing observed to population incidences of invasive breast cancer using Australian Cancer Incidence and Mortality Books. Six cases of invasive breast cancer were observed.

The strongest genetic risk factor for MBC is represented by inherited BRCA2 mutations, whereas the association between MBC and BRCA1 mutations is less clear. MBC appears to be biologically similar to breast cancer in females, however the phenotypic characteristics of BRCA1/2-related MBCs are not yet well elucidated.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of MBC in a large and well-characterized population-based series of 108 MBCs from Tuscany (Central Italy) and to evaluate associations between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation status and clinical-pathological features including breast/ovarian cancer first-degree family history, tumor histology and grade, proliferative activity, estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Results BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations were identified in ten MBCs, in particular, two cases (1.9%) carried BRCA1 and eight cases (7.4%) carried BRCA2 mutations. The same BRCA1 mutation (3347delAG) was detected in two unrelated MBC cases. Three novel BRCA2 pathogenic mutations were found. Statistically significant associations emerged between BRCA2-related tumors and absence of PR expression (P = 0.008), HER2 over-expression (P = 0.002) and high tumor grade (P = 0.005). Conclusions Here, we (i) reported that in our population about 9% of MBC cases are accounted for by BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations; (ii) enlarged the BRCA2 mutational spectrum and (iii) characterized a specific phenotype associated with BRCA2-related MBCs suggestive of aggressive behavior.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA double-strand break repair, DNA alterations that can be caused by exposure to reactive oxygen species, a main source of which are mitochondria. Mitochondrial genome variations affect electron transport chain efficiency and reactive oxygen species production. Individuals with different mitochondrial haplogroups differ in their metabolism and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Variability in mitochondrial genetic background can alter reactive oxygen species production, leading to cancer risk. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondrial haplogroups modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.\n\nMETHODS: We genotyped 22,214 (11,421 affected, 10,793 unaffected) mutation carriers belonging to the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 for 129 mitochondrial polymorphisms using the iCOGS array. Haplogroup inference and association detection were performed using a phylogenetic approach. ALTree was applied to explore the reference mitochondrial evolutionary tree and detect subclades enriched in affected or unaffected individuals.\n\nRESULTS: We discovered that subclade T1a1 was depleted in affected BRCA2 mutation carriers compared with the rest of clade T (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.34 to 0.88; P = 0.01). Compared with the most frequent haplogroup in the general population (that is, H and T clades), the T1a1 haplogroup has a HR of 0.62 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95; P = 0.03). We also identified three potential susceptibility loci, including G13708A/rs28359178, which has demonstrated an inverse association with familial breast cancer risk.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how original approaches such as the phylogeny-based method we used can empower classical molecular epidemiological studies aimed at identifying association or risk modification effects."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "8791478", "_score": 416.1527, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Causality [D015984:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn [D030342:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]"], "text": "Hereditary predisposition to breast cancer.\n\n\nThe breast cancer susceptibility gene on chromosome 17q, BRCA1, has now been isolated.

Lymphocyte specimens from peripheral blood were processed for BRCA1 and BRCA2 by complete sequencing. Family history through three generations was obtained. Available paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were processed for immunohistochemical staining.\n\nRESULTS: In the cohort of 60 patients, nine patients with 11 deleterious mutations (six in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2) and seven missense mutations of unknown significance were found. Two patients had deleterious mutations in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 (double mutant). One half of the mutations were novel, and no founder mutations were observed in this cohort. Most of the BRCA-associated patients had no family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. The expression of HER-2/neu, cyclin D1, and hormone receptors was less common, and p53 overexpression was more common in BRCA-associated tumors.\n\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Korean women with breast cancer at a young age was high.

Data from previous studies show that among African American women a greater proportion of breast cancer cases are diagnosed at age <45 years in comparison with Caucasians. Because breast cancer occurring at a young age is one of the hallmarks of high penetrance genes, the prevalence, spectrum, and effects of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations may differ substantially between African Americans and Caucasians, and further investigation is warranted. We conducted a hospital-based study of African American breast cancer patients with early age at diagnosis (</=45 years) or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. We identified four deleterious mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 among the 10 families tested, of which two were novel BRCA2 mutations, one was the west African founder mutation (BRCA1 943ins10), and one was a recurrent mutation that may be a candidate for a second African American founder mutation (BRCA1 IVS13+1G>A).

Germ-line mutations of BRCA2 and, at lower frequency, of BRCA1 are implicated in a relatively small proportion of MBC cases. Common polymorphic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may represent breast cancer (BC) susceptibility alleles and could be associated with a modestly increased risk of MBC at population level. Considering the relevant role of BRCA2 in MBC, we investigated whether the BRCA2 N372H variant, representing the only common non-synonymous polymorphism in BRCA2, might modulate the risk of BC in male populations.\n\nMETHODS: A case-control study was performed comparing a population-based series of 99 MBC cases, characterized for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, with 261 male population controls, all residing in Tuscany, Central Italy. All MBC cases and controls were genotyped for the BRCA2 N372H allele by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. To evaluate the genotype specific risk of the BRCA2 N372H variant, MBC carriers of germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations were excluded from the analyses.\n\nRESULTS: No association emerged in univariate and age-adjusted analyses.

Recently a number of germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene have been identified in families prone to breast cancer. We screened 100 primary breast cancers from Japanese patients for BRCA2 mutations, using PCR-SSCP. We found two germline mutations and one somatic mutation in our patient group. One of the germline mutations was an insertion of an Alu element into exon 22, which resulted in alternative splicing that skipped exon 22. The presence of a 64-bp polyadenylate tract and evidence for an 8-bp target-site duplication of the inserted DNA implied that the retrotransposal insertion of a transcriptionally active Alu element caused this event.

Laboratory-based methods that can distinguish between carriers of pathogenic mutations and non-carriers are likely to have utility for the classification of these sequence variants. To identify predictors of pathogenic mutation status in familial breast cancer patients, we explored the use of gene expression arrays to assess the effect of two DNA-damaging agents (irradiation and mitomycin C) on cellular response in relation to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. A range of regimes was used to treat 27 lymphoblastoid cell-lines (LCLs) derived from affected women in high-risk breast cancer families (nine BRCA1, nine BRCA2, and nine non-BRCA1/2 or BRCAX individuals) and nine LCLs from healthy individuals. Using an RNA-pooling strategy, we found that treating LCLs with 1.2 microM mitomycin C and measuring the gene expression profiles 1 hour post-treatment had the greatest potential to discriminate BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX mutation status. A classifier was built using the expression profile of nine QRT-PCR validated genes that were associated with BRCA1, BRCA2, and BRCAX status in RNA pools.

The BRCA2 protein has been proposed to function in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. Using an immunopurification-mass spectrometry approach to identify novel proteins that associate with the BRCA2 gene product, we found that a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP11, formed specific complexes with BRCA2. Moreover, BRCA2 was constitutively ubiquitinated in vivo in the absence of detectable proteasomal degradation. Mitomycin C (MMC) led to decreased BRCA2 protein levels associated with increased ubiquitination, consistent with proteasome-dependent degradation. While BRCA2 could be deubiquitinated by USP11 in transient overexpression assays, a catalytically inactive USP11 mutant had no effect on BRCA2 ubiquitination or protein levels. Antagonism of USP11 function either through expression of this mutant or through RNA interference increased cellular sensitivity to MMC in a BRCA2-dependent manner.

The aims of this study were to derive penetrance estimates for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and contralateral breast cancer in a prospective series of mutation carriers and to assess how these risks are modified by common breast cancer susceptibility alleles.\n\nMETHODS: Prospective cancer risks were estimated using a cohort of 978 BRCA1 and 909 BRCA2 carriers from the United Kingdom. Nine hundred eighty-eight women had no breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis at baseline, 1509 women were unaffected by ovarian cancer, and 651 had been diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer. Cumulative risks were obtained using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Associations between cancer risk and covariables of interest were evaluated using Cox regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\nRESULTS: The average cumulative risks by age 70 years for BRCA1 carriers were estimated to be 60% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 44% to 75%) for breast cancer, 59% (95% CI = 43% to 76%) for ovarian cancer, and 83% (95% CI = 69% to 94%) for contralateral breast cancer.

The objective is to develop and pilot test a decision aid for breast cancer prevention for women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. The decision aid was developed and evaluated in three stages. In the first stage, the decision aid was developed and reviewed by cancer genetics experts. The second stage was a review of the decision aid by women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation for acceptability and feasibility. The final stage was a pre-test--post-test evaluation of the decision aid. Twenty-one women completed the pre-test questionnaire and 20 completed the post-test questionnaire. After using the decision aid, there was a significant decline in mean decisional conflict scores (p = 0.001), a significant improvement in knowledge scores (p = 0.004), and fewer women uncertain about prophylactic mastectomy (p = 0.003) and prophylactic oophorectomy (p = 0.009). Use of the decision aid decreased decisional conflict to levels suggestive of implementation of a decision.

Recent studies suggest that the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products may function in the sensing and/or repair of DNA damage. To investigate this possibility, we determined the effects of various DNA-damaging agents and other cytotoxic agents on the mRNA levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the MCF-7 and other human breast cancer cell lines. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II), camptothecin (a topoisomerase I inhibitor), and ultraviolet radiation induced significant decreases in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels. Decreased levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs were observed within 6-12 h after treatment with adriamycin and persisted for at least 72 h. Adriamycin also induced decreases in BRCA1 protein levels; but these decreases required several days. U.V. radiation induced dose-dependent down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs, with significant decreases in both mRNAs at doses as low as 2.5 J/m2, a dose that yielded very little cytotoxicity. Adriamycin-induced down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs was first observed at doses that yielded relatively little cytotoxicity and little or no apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Adriamycin and U.V. radiation induced distinct dose- and time-dependent alterations in the cell cycle distribution; but these alterations did not correlate well with corresponding changes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels. However, the adriamycin-induced reduction in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNA levels was correlated with p53 functional status. MCF-7 cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant p53 (143 val-->ala) required at least tenfold higher doses of adriamycin to down-regulate BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs than did parental MCF-7 cells or control-transfected MCF-7 clones.

In addition, the applicability of many risk-assessment tools, such as the Manchester Scoring System and BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) which were developed based on mutation rates observed primarily in Caucasian populations using data from multiplex families, and in populations where the rate of breast cancer is higher, has not been widely tested in Asia or in Asians living elsewhere. Here, we report the results of genetic testing for mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes in a series of families with breast cancer in the multi-ethnic population (Malay, Chinese and Indian) of Malaysia.\n\nMETHOD: A total of 187 breast cancer patients with either early-onset breast cancer (at age </= 40 years) or a personal and/or family history of breast or ovarian cancer were comprehensively tested by full sequencing of both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Two algorithms to predict the presence of mutations, the Manchester Scoring System and BOADICEA, were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty-seven deleterious mutations were detected (14 in BRCA1 and 13 in BRCA2), only one of which was found in two unrelated individuals (BRCA2 490 delCT). In addition, 47 variants of uncertain clinical significance were identified (16 in BRCA1 and 31 in BRCA2). Notably, many mutations are novel (13 of the 30 BRCA1 mutations and 24 of the 44 BRCA2). We report that while there were an equal proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in the Chinese population in our study, there were significantly more BRCA2 mutations among the Malays. In addition, we show that the predictive power of the BOADICEA risk-prediction model and the Manchester Scoring System was significantly better for BRCA1 than BRCA2, but that the overall sensitivity, specificity and positive-predictive value was lower in this population than has been previously reported in Caucasian populations.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study underscores the need for larger collaborative studies among non-Caucasian populations to validate the role of genetic testing and the use of risk-prediction models in ensuring that the other populations in the world may also benefit from the genomics and genetics era."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20798986", "_score": 414.07254, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Neoplasms, Multiple Primary [D009378:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Odds Ratio [D016017:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide [D020641:major]", "Proportional Hazards Models [D016016:minor]", "Steroid 17-alpha-Hydroxylase [D013254:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Young Adult [D055815:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Association Studies [D056726:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Genotype [D005838:minor]"], "text": "The CYP17A1 -34T > C polymorphism and breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nExposure to estrogen has a major effect on breast cancer risk.

To better define the involvement of these genes in sporadic cancers, we characterized expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cancer cell lines derived from neoplasms of the ovary, prostate, and breast and compared them with those expressed in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells established from these organs. We observed upregulation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 expression in six of seven ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA429, OVCA432, ALST, DOV13, and SKOV3) when compared with levels found in normal ovary surface epithelial cells. Furthermore, five cancerous or immortalized prostatic epithelial cell lines (BPH-1, TSU-Pr1, LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145) also expressed higher levels of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mRNA than did primary cultures of normal prostatic epithelial cells. In contrast, only the estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 cell line overexpressed these messages, whereas the estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cell lines Hs578T, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 showed no change in expression levels when compared with normal breast epithelial cells. In addition, expanding on our recent identification of a novel BRCA2 transcript variant carrying an in-frame exon 12 deletion (BRCA2 delta 12), we report increased expression of this variant in several ovarian, prostate, and mammary cancer cell lines (OVCA420, OVCA433, ALST, DOV13, SKOV3, TSU-Pr1, DU145, and MDA-MB-468). Most notably, high levels of BRCA2 delta 12 mRNA were detected in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and in an androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU-145. Interestingly, the wild-type BRCA2 transcript was barely detectable in DU145, which could be used as a model system for future investigations on BRCA2 delta 12 function. Taken together, our data suggest disruption of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene expression in certain epithelial cancer cell lines of the ovary, prostate, and breast. Because wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene products increase during cell-cycle progression and are believed to exert growth-inhibitory action, enhanced expression of these genes in cancer cells may represent a negative feedback mechanism for curbing proliferation in fast-growing cells.

Over the past years several rearrangements have been identified in BRCA1, while few studies have been designed to screen this type of mutations in BRCA2. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA2 gene in Spanish breast/ovarian cancer families. The multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was employed to search gross deletions or duplications of BRCA2 in 335 Spanish moderate to high-risk breast/ovarian cancer families previously screened negative for point mutations by conventional methods. Four different and novel large genomic alterations were consistently identified by MLPA in five families, respectively: deletions of exon 2, exons 10-12 and exons 15-16 and duplication of exon 20 (in two families). RT-PCR experiments confirmed the deletion of exons 15-16. All patients harbouring a genomic rearrangement were members of high-risk families, with three or more breast/ovarian cancer cases or the presence of breast cancer in males.

Ninety-three had BRCA1 mutations; 71, BRCA2 mutations; one, both mutations; 1,550, sporadic breast cancer; and 1,505, familial breast cancer (without known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation).

In addition to an involvement in inherited susceptibility to cancer, these tumour suppressor genes are targets for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers of the same type found in the familial forms. An exception is BRCA1, which contributes to a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian cancer, but undergoes mutation at very low rates in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers. This finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma. A second, recently identified familial breast cancer gene, BRCA2 (refs 5-8), accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1. Like BRCA1, BRCA2 behaves as a dominantly inherited tumour suppressor gene. Individuals who inherit one mutant allele are at increased risk for breast cancer, and the tumours they develop lose the wild-type allele by heterozygous deletion. The BRCA2 coding sequence is huge, composed of 26 exons that span 10,443 bp.

Patients were followed from the initial diagnosis of breast cancer until either ovarian cancer, prophylactic oophorectomy, death, or 2002. The medical treatment records and pathology documents were reviewed. Information that was abstracted from the medical charts included date of breast cancer diagnosis, stage of disease, use of chemotherapy, use of radiation therapy, usage of tamoxifen, oophorectomy, recurrence, second malignancy, and vital status.\n\nRESULTS: The 10-year actuarial risk of ovarian cancer after breast cancer was 12.7% for BRCA1 carriers and 6.8% for BRCA2 carriers (P = 0.03).

However, as MBC is a rare disease there are difficulties to undertake studies to identify specific MBC subgroups. At present, it is still largely unknown whether BRCA-related breast cancer (BC) in men may display specific characteristics as it is for BRCA-related BC in women. To investigate the clinical-pathologic features of MBC in association with BRCA mutations we established a collaborative Italian Multicenter Study on MBC with the aim to recruit a large series of MBCs. A total of 382 MBCs, including 50 BRCA carriers, were collected from ten Italian Investigation Centres covering the whole country. In MBC patients, BRCA2 mutations were associated with family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p<0.0001), personal history of other cancers (p=0.044) and contralateral BC (p=0.001). BRCA2-associated MBCs presented with high tumor grade (p=0.001), PR-(p=0.026) and HER2+ (p=0.001) status. In a multivariate logistic model BRCA2 mutations showed positive association with personal history of other cancers (OR 11.42, 95% CI 1.79-73.08) and high tumor grade (OR 4.93, 95% CI 1.02-23.88) and inverse association with PR+ status (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.92). Based on immunohistochemical (IHC) profile, four molecular subtypes of MBC were identified. Luminal A was the most common subtype (67.7%), luminal B was observed in 26.5% of the cases and HER2 positive and triple negative were represented by 2.1% and 3.7% of tumors, respectively. Intriguingly, we found that both luminal B and HER2 positive subtypes were associated with high tumor grade (p=0.003 and 0.006, respectively) and with BRCA2 mutations (p=0.016 and 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that BRCA2-related MBCs represent a subgroup of tumors with a peculiar phenotype characterized by aggressive behavior.

Unspecified details of screening schedules are a challenge for implementing guidelines.\n\nMETHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo computer model was used to simulate screening in asymptomatic women who were BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Three dual-modality strategies were compared with digital mammography (DM) alone: 1) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 25 years (Alt25), 2) annual MRI beginning at age 25 years with alternating DM added at age 30 years (MRI25/Alt30), and 3) DM and MRI alternating at 6-month intervals beginning at age 30 years (Alt30).

Additional outcomes included potential harms of screening, and lifetime costs stratified into component categories (screening and diagnosis, treatment, mortality, and patient time costs).\n\nRESULTS: All 3 dual-modality screening strategies increased QALYs and costs. Alt30 screening had the lowest incremental costs per additional QALY gained (BRCA1, $74,200 per QALY; BRCA2, $215,700 per QALY).

These two genes alone account for the vast majority of hereditary breast cancer families.

We screened 49 putative sporadic breast tumors using this methodology, targeting four BRCA1 mutations (185delAG, 5382insC, R1443X, and E1250X) and a single BRCA2 mutation (6174delT).\n\nRESULTS: Using the polymerase chain reaction-mediated, site-directed mutagenesis assay, we identified two mutations, namely, a 185delAG mutation (BRCA1) and a 6174delT mutation (BRCA2).

Testing for protein-truncating mutations in exons 2, 11, and 20 of BRCA1 and exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2 was conducted in a population-based sample of 388 Australian women with breast cancer diagnosed before age 40.

Of the 18 mutation-carrying cases (9 BRCA1 and 9 BRCA2), only 5 (1 BRCA1 and 4 BRCA2) had at least one affected relative, so family history of breast cancer was not a strong predictor of mutation status in this setting. The risk in mutation carriers was, on average, 9 times the population risk [95% confidence interval (CI), 4-23; P < 0.001]. Penetrance to age 70 was 40% (95% CI, 15-65%), about half that estimated from BCLC families.

Unfortunately, despite intensive effort, the identification of additional breast cancer predisposition genes has so far been unsuccessful, presumably because of genetic heterogeneity, low penetrance, or recessive/polygenic mechanisms. These non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families (termed BRCAx families) comprise a histopathologically heterogeneous group, further supporting their origin from multiple genetic events. Accordingly, the identification of a method to successfully subdivide BRCAx families into recognizable groups could be of considerable value to further genetic analysis. We have previously shown that global gene expression analysis can identify unique and distinct expression profiles in breast tumors from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Here we show that gene expression profiling can discover novel classes among BRCAx tumors, and differentiate them from BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors. Moreover, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to cDNA arrays revealed specific somatic genetic alterations within the BRCAx subgroups.

Peripheral blood from 21 BRCA1 mutation carriers (12 with BC and 9 healthy), 24 BRCA2 carriers (13 with BC and 11 healthy), 15 familial BC patients without detected mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 and 16 controls without familial history of cancer (5 with BC and 11 healthy) were irradiated or treated with MMC.

The monoallelic BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic mutations seem not to be associated with an enhanced radiosensitivity. The mutation of one BRCA2 allele conferred an increased sensitivity to MMC, presumably because of the role of this gene in the repair of MMC-induced DNA damage.

The lifetime risk of a woman being diagnosed with breast cancer is approximately 12.5%. For women who carry the deleterious mutation in either of the BRCA genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2, the risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer is significantly increased. In recent years there has been increased penetrance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated breast cancer, prompting investigation into the role of modifiable risk factors in this group. Previous investigations into this topic have relied on participants recalling lifetime weight changes and subjective methods of recording physical activity. The influence of obesity-related biomarkers, which may explain the link between obesity, physical activity and breast cancer risk, has not been investigated prospectively in this group. This paper describes the design of a prospective cohort study investigating the role of predictive and modifiable risk factors for breast cancer in unaffected BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers.\n\nMETHODS/DESIGN: Participants will be recruited from breast cancer family risk clinics and genetics clinics. Lifestyle risk factors that will be investigated will include body composition, metabolic syndrome and its components, physical activity and dietary intake. PBMC telomere length will be measured as a potential predictor of breast cancer occurrence. Measurements will be completed on entry to the study and repeated at two years and five years.

We searched the database of PubMed for eligible studies about the effectiveness of tamoxifen on CBC risk among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and we calculated the pooled relative risks (RRs) for CBC risk along with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Fixed- or random-effects model was conducted according to study heterogeneity. Four non-overlapping studies met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. Tamoxifen was found to be significantly associated with reduced risk of CBC among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (summary RR = 0.56, 95 % CI = 0.41-0.76).

Discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes more than a decade ago has had a tremendous impact on patient care allowing for early detection and prevention of breast cancer. However, deleterious mutations within the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes cause at most 3-8% of all breast cancer cases. New data indicate that genomic rearrangements within the same genes may occasionally identify additional carriers of nonfunctional BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Such genomic rearrangements are missed by conventional sequencing. The remainder of the unexplained familial risk is presumably due to other yet unidentified high penetrance genes, but polygenic mechanisms and high frequency low penetrance tumor susceptibility genes are likely to account for a greater proportion of familial breast cancers. In this regard, there is growing evidence that a common variant of the type I TGF-ss receptor, TGFBR1*6A, may account for approximately 5% of all breast cancer cases, a fraction similar to that attributable to BRCA1 and BRCA2. Such genes may also modify the penetrance of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. In the next decade, screening for combinations of high and low penetrance genes will likely permit the identification of a large fraction of inherited breast cancer cases and will further reduce the burden of familial breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "8875258", "_score": 410.70538, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Animals [D000818:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "Recent advances in understanding of genetic susceptibility to breast cancer.\n\n\nThe breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, was isolated in 1994.

The relative rarity of male breast cancer (MBC) limits our understanding of the epidemiologic, genetic and clinical features of this tumor.\n\nMETHODS: From 1997 to 2003, 10 MBC patients were referred to our Institute for genetic counselling and BRCA1/2 testing. Here we report on the genetic and phenotypic characterization of 10 families with MBC from the North East of Italy. In particular, we wished to assess the occurrence of specific cancer types in relatives of MBC probands in families with and without BRCA2 predisposing mutations. Moreover, families with recurrent BRCA2 mutations were also characterized by haplotype analysis using 5 BRCA2-linked dinucleotide repeat markers and 8 intragenic BRCA2 polymorphisms.\n\nRESULTS: Two pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene were observed: the 9106C>T (Q2960X) and the IVS16-2A>G (splicing) mutations, each in 2 cases. A BRCA1 mutation of uncertain significance 4590C>G (P1491A) was also observed. In families with BRCA2 mutations, female breast cancer was more frequent in the first and second-degree relatives compared to the families with wild type BRCA1/2 (31.9% vs. 8.0% p = 0.001). Reconstruction of the chromosome phasing in three families and the analysis of three isolated cases with the IVS16-2A>G BRCA2 mutation identified the same haplotype associated with MBC, supporting the possibility that this founder mutation previously detected in Slovenian families is also present in the North East of our Country. Moreover, analysis of one family with the 9106C>T BRCA2 mutation allowed the identification of common haplotypes for both microsatellite and intragenic polymorphisms segregating with the mutation. Three isolated cases with the same mutation shared the same intragenic polymorphisms and three 5' microsatellite markers, but showed a different haplotype for 3' markers, which were common to all three cases.\n\nCONCLUSION: The 9106C>T and the IVS16-2A>G mutations constitute recurrent BRCA2 mutations in MBC cases from the North-East of Italy and may be associated with a founder effect. Knowledge of these two recurrent BRCA2 mutations predisposing to MBC may facilitate the analyses aimed at the identification of mutation carriers in our geographic area."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "19644536", "_score": 410.46533, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Lymphatic Metastasis [D008207:minor]", "Mastectomy, Segmental [D015412:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Transplantation, Autologous [D014182:minor]", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]", "Bone Neoplasms [D001859:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/secondary [Q000556:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]", "Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast [D018270:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/secondary [Q000556:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]", "Combined Modality Therapy [D003131:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Eleven years disease-free: role of chemotherapy in metastatic BRCA2-related breast cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast, staged as pT1N3, was diagnosed in a 41-year-old premenopausal French-Canadian woman.

Furthermore, direct binding of human RAD51 to each of the four single 30-amino acid BRC repeats located at the 5' portion of exon 11 of BRCA2 was demonstrated.

At present, over thousand distinct BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been identified. Specific mutations are found to be common within particular populations, resulting from genetic founder effects. To investigate the contribution of germline mutations in these two genes to inherited breast cancer in Iran, we performed BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation analyses in ten Iranian high risk breast cancer families. This is the first study analysing the complete coding sequences of both genes that concerns the Iranian population.\n\nMETHODS: BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation detection included sequencing of the coding and the 3' and 5' untranslated regions. To detect large genomic rearrangements in the BRCA1 gene semi-quantitative multiplex PCR was performed.\n\nRESULTS: Two pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene were detected: a novel deletion c.4415_4418delAGAA and a previously described insertion c.6033_6034insGT. In addition, one intronic variation g.5075-53C > T and a deletion/insertion g.*381_389del9ins29 in the 3' untranslated region of BRCA1 were found in two of the investigated families. Both sequence alterations were absent in an age matched Iranian control group. The BRCA2 homozygous variation p.N372H, previously associated with an increased risk for developing breast cancer, was not identified in this study. We did not detect large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 in patients tested negatively for disease causing mutations in both genes by standard sequencing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: At present, the BRCA2 mutations c.4415_4418delAGAA and c.6033_6034insGT have not been identified in any investigated population except the Iranian. Whether both mutations are specific for the Iranian population or a special subgroup remains to be investigated in larger studies.

DNA and RNA were extracted from the blood of the proband and her family, and was used for BRCA gene mutation/deletion screening and RNA splicing analysis.\n\nRESULTS: BRCA2 c.7806-9T > G was identified in the proband, which was suggestive of a variant. This change was also found in two sisters of the proband with a history of breast cancer, as well as from the proband's maternal gastric cancer. The only sibling free of breast cancer did not carry the BRCA2 variant, thus demonstrating that the mutation segregates with the clinical phenotype in this family. RNA analysis on the proband blood sample revealed three aberrant splicing variants: c.7806_7874del, c.7806_7976del, and c.7806-8_7806-1ins.

There was no correlation between PML protein expression and age, histological types, estrogen and progesterone receptor, c-erbB-2 and PCNA expression, TNM classification, disease-free and overall survival. In conclusion, the PML protein is downregulated in approximately 30% of breast cancers cases.

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes can impact protein function leading to genomic instability facilitated by growth stimulation and increased cancer risk. Thus, 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes involved in base excision repair (XRCC1, APEX, POLD1), BRCA1 protein interaction (BRIP1, ZNF350, BRCA2), and growth regulation (TGFss1, IGFBP3) were evaluated.\n\nMETHODS: Genomic DNA samples were used in Taqman 5'-nuclease assays for most SNPs. Breast cancer risk to ages 50 and 70 were estimated using the kin-cohort method in which genotypes of relatives are inferred based on the known genotype of the index subject and Mendelian inheritance patterns. Family cancer history data was collected from a series of genotyped breast cancer cases (N = 748) identified within a cohort of female US radiologic technologists. Among 2,430 female first-degree relatives of cases, 190 breast cancers were reported.\n\nRESULTS: Genotypes associated with increased risk were: XRCC1 R194W (WW and RW vs. RR, cumulative risk up to age 70, risk ratio (RR) = 2.3; 95% CI 1.3-3.8); XRCC1 R399Q (QQ vs. RR, cumulative risk up to age 70, RR = 1.9; 1.1-3.9); and BRIP1 (or BACH1) P919S (SS vs. PP, cumulative risk up to age 50, RR = 6.9; 1.6-29.3). The risk for those heterozygous for BRCA2 N372H and APEX D148E were significantly lower than risks for homozygotes of either allele, and these were the only two results that remained significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. No associations with breast cancer were observed for: APEX Q51H; XRCC1 R280H; IGFPB3 -202A>C; TGFss1 L10P, P25R, and T263I; BRCA2 N289H and T1915M; BRIP1 -64A>C; and ZNF350 (or ZBRK1) 1845C>T, L66P, R501S, and S472P.\n\nCONCLUSION: Some variants in genes within the base-excision repair pathway (XRCC1) and BRCA1 interacting proteins (BRIP1) may play a role as low penetrance breast cancer risk alleles.

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 80% and 20% of the mutations overall, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of detecting a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in this study group were the presence of a single family member with both breast and ovarian cancer (P <.0009; odds ratio [OR], 5.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.04 to 15.76) and a young average age at breast cancer diagnosis in the family (P <.0016; OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.38).\n\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that at least half of breast/ovarian families evaluated in a high-risk cancer evaluation clinic may have germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Whether the remaining families have mutations in noncoding regions in BRCA1, mutations in other, as-yet-unidentified, low-penetrance susceptibility genes, or represent chance clustering remains to be determined."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17021353", "_score": 409.44135, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Logistic Models [D016015:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]", "Receptors, Estrogen [D011960:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]", "Receptors, Progesterone [D011980:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]", "Australia [D001315:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Surveys and Questionnaires [D011795:minor]", "Time Factors [D013997:minor]", "United States [D014481:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Canada [D002170:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Carcinoma in Situ [D002278:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast [D018270:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "Contraceptives, Oral [D003276:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]"], "text": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, oral contraceptive use, and breast cancer before age 50.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Understanding the effect of oral contraceptives on risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers is important because oral contraceptive use is a common, modifiable practice.\n\nMETHODS: We studied 497 BRCA1 and 307 BRCA2 mutation carriers, of whom 195 and 128, respectively, had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

Brca1 and Brca2 proteins are both involved in the cellular defence against DNA damage, although the precise function of the proteins is still not known. Some studies on a small number of samples as well as the present pilot study also suggested that BRCA1 heterozygosity may lead to impaired repair of ionizing-radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. The purpose of the study was to test in a larger family-matched study whether carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have an increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In a blind study, the effect of different germ-line mutations in one allele of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene on the ability to repair X-ray-induced DNA breaks was investigated. Fibroblasts and lymphocytes were taken from heterozygotic individuals (BRCA1+ /- and BRCA2+ /-) with different mutations and from relatives proven to be non-carriers of the BRCA mutations. Rejoining of DNA breaks was analysed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (for fibroblasts) or the comet assay (for lymphocytes).\n\nRESULTS: Significant interindividual differences were found in the capacities of the fibroblasts and lymphocytes to rejoin DNA breaks induced by X-radiation. However, these differences were not related to heterozygosity in BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Cells from carriers of mutations in one allele of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have no gross defects in their ability to rejoin radiation-induced DNA breaks.

We investigated the distribution and the nature of BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations and polymorphisms in a cohort of 204 Indian breast cancer patients and 140 age-matched controls.\n\nMETHOD: Cases were selected with regard to early onset disease (< or =40 years) and family history of breast and ovarian cancer. Two hundred four breast cancer cases along with 140 age-matched controls were analyzed for mutations. All coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were screened by heteroduplex analysis followed by direct sequencing of detected variants.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 18 genetic alterations were identified. Three deleterious frame-shift mutations (185delAG in exon 2; 4184del4 and 3596del4 in exon 11) were identified in BRCA1, along with one missense mutation (K1667R), one 5'UTR alteration (22C>G), three intronic variants (IVS10-12delG, IVS13+2T>C, IVS7+38T>C) and one silent substitution (5154C>T). Similarly three pathogenic protein-truncating mutations (6376insAA in exon 11, 8576insC in exon19, and 9999delA in exon 27) along with one missense mutation (A2951T), four intronic alterations (IVS2+90T>A, IVS7+75A>T, IVS8+56C>T, IVS25+58insG) and one silent substitution (1593A>G) were identified in BRCA2. Four previously reported polymorphisms (K1183R, S1613G, and M1652I in BRCA1, and 7470A>G in BRCA2) were detected in both controls and breast cancer patients. Rare BRCA1/2 sequence alterations were observed in 15 out of 105 (14.2%) early-onset cases without family history and 11.7% (4/34) breast cancer cases with family history. Of these, six were pathogenic protein truncating mutations. In addition, several variants of uncertain clinical significance were identified. Among these are two missense variants, one alteration of a consensus splice donor sequence, and a variant that potentially disrupts translational initiation.\n\nCONCLUSION: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations appear to account for a lower proportion of breast cancer patients at increased risk of harboring such mutations in Northern India (6/204, 2.9%) than has been reported in other populations. However, given the limited extent of reported family history among these patients, the observed mutation frequency is not dissimilar from that reported in other cohorts of early onset breast cancer patients. Several of the identified mutations are unique and novel to Indian patients."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9537232", "_score": 408.80096, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Transcriptional Activation [D015533:major]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Base Sequence [D001483:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Exons [D005091:major]", "Family Health [D005192:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]"], "text": "A large deletion disrupts the exon 3 transcription activation domain of the BRCA2 gene in a breast/ovarian cancer family.\n\n\nWe describe the identification of a large deletion in the BRCA2 gene as the disease-causing mutation in a Swedish breast/ovarian cancer family.

To investigate whether common genetic variants modify penetrance for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we undertook a two-staged genome-wide association study in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stage 1 using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, 592,163 filtered SNPs genotyped were available on 899 young (<40 years) affected and 804 unaffected carriers of European ancestry. Associations were evaluated using a survival-based score test adjusted for familial correlations and stratified by country of the study and BRCA2*6174delT mutation status. The genomic inflation factor (\u03bb) was 1.011. The stage 1 association analysis revealed multiple variants associated with breast cancer risk: 3 SNPs had p-values<10(-5) and 39 SNPs had p-values<10(-4). These variants included several previously associated with sporadic breast cancer risk and two novel loci on chromosome 20 (rs311499) and chromosome 10 (rs16917302). The chromosome 10 locus was in ZNF365, which contains another variant that has recently been associated with breast cancer in an independent study of unselected cases. In stage 2, the top 85 loci from stage 1 were genotyped in 1,264 cases and 1,222 controls. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for stage 1 and 2 were combined and estimated using a retrospective likelihood approach, stratified by country of residence and the most common mutation, BRCA2*6174delT. The combined per allele HR of the minor allele for the novel loci rs16917302 was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.86, ) and for rs311499 was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.85, ). FGFR2 rs2981575 had the strongest association with breast cancer risk (per allele HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39, ).

Valid estimates of the magnitude of the lifetime risk of breast cancer in BRCA gene mutation carriers are needed for genetic counseling. Recent results suggest that penetrance has increased in recent birth cohorts. We examined the cumulative breast cancer incidence and mortality before age 70 over a diagnosis period of 80 years in Icelandic women who carried the BRCA2 founder mutation 999del5.\n\nMETHODS: Information on all breast cancers diagnosed in Iceland since 1911 was obtained from the Icelandic Cancer Registry. Mutation status was determined by molecular analysis of tissue samples for 847 breast cancer probands who were diagnosed from 1921 through 1985 and selected without knowledge of family history of breast cancer. We estimated the cumulative incidence and mortality from breast cancer before age 70 years in BRCA2 mutation carriers from the observed risks in first-degree relatives who were classified according to mutation status of probands and followed-up through 2002. Poisson modeling of these risks was also carried out. All statistical tests were two-sided.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 847 probands, 88 carried the BRCA2 999del5 mutation and 759 did not. According to Poisson modeling, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer before age 70 years in mutation carriers increased from 18.6% (95% CI = 11.0% to 29.5%) in calendar year 1920 to 71.9% (95% CI = 45.9% to 100%) in 2002 (P < .001); in relatives of probands who did not carry the BRCA2 mutation and in the general Icelandic population incidence increased over the same period from 2.6% to 10.7% and from 1.8% to 7.5%, respectively (all increases of approximately fourfold). During the same period, the cumulative risk of death from breast cancer before age 70 years for BRCA2 mutation carriers increased from 12.1% (95% CI = 5.3% to 23.9%) to 26.9% (95% CI = 10.9% to 55.5%) (P = .08). However, because the probands were breast cancer patients and not a random sample from the population, some bias in the estimation of time trends in penetrance cannot be ruled out.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the penetrance of the Icelandic BRCA2 founder mutation increased nearly fourfold in 80 years, whereas the risk of death from breast cancer before age 70 years increased only approximately twofold. Changes in penetrance with time should be considered when penetrance is estimated."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "23009828", "_score": 408.6585, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Heterozygote [D006579:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Incidence [D015994:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Netherlands [D009426:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Ovariectomy [D010052:major]/methods [Q000379:minor]/statistics & numerical data [Q000706:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Risk Reduction Behavior [D040242:minor]", "Salpingostomy [D012489:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]/statistics & numerical data [Q000706:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Carcinoma [D002277:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]", "Fallopian Tubes [D005187:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]"], "text": "Breast Cancer Incidence After Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers.\n\n\nPremenopausal risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers effectively reduces ovarian cancer risk, but also reduces breast cancer risk.

To study the possible additional genetic components, we conducted single-locus and two-locus segregation analyses, with and without a polygenic background, using three-generation families ascertained through 858 women with breast cancer diagnosed at age <40 years, ascertained through population cancer registries in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. Extensive testing for deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, to date, has identified 34 carriers. Our analysis suggested that, after other possible unmeasured familial factors are adjusted for and the known BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers are excluded, there appears to be a residual dominantly inherited risk of female breast cancer in addition to that derived from mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. This study also suggests that there is a substantial recessively inherited risk of early-onset breast cancer. According to the best-fitting model, after excluding known carriers of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, about 1/250 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1/500 to 1/125) women have a recessive risk of 86% (95% CI 69%-100%) by age 50 years and of almost 100% by age 60 years. Possible reasons that our study has implicated a novel strong recessive effect include our inclusion of data on lineal aunts and grandmothers, study of families ascertained through women with early-onset breast cancer, allowance for multiple familial factors in the analysis, and removal of families for whom the cause (i.e., BRCA1 or BRCA2) is known.

We found that up-regulated HR after transfection of wild-type (wt) BRCA2 into a human tumor line with mutant BRCA2 was linked to increased radioresistance. In addition, BRCA2-mediated enhancement of HR depended on the interaction with Rad51. In contrast to the tumor suppressor BRCA1, which is involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, BRCA2 status had no impact on the other principal double-strand break repair pathway, nonhomologous end joining.

BRCA1 breast cancers may have a worse prognosis but may, however be amenable to treatment such as chemotherapy for small high-grade, lymph node negative breast cancers. Paradoxically, tamoxifen may provide effective adjuvant and chemopreventive therapy despite the predominantly negative estrogen receptor status of BRCA1 breast cancers. The distinctive biology of BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers bodes well for the development of targeted cancer therapies. Cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 loss of function are deficient in DNA double strand break repair and are sensitized to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, causing the persistence of DNA lesions which are usually repaired by homologous recombination and ultimately leading to apoptosis. The potentially high efficacy and low toxicity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors presents an opportunity for targeted cancer therapeutics for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation carriers. Genotype-tailored chemoprevention may be feasible which could theoretically eliminate single cells that have sustained a second hit, before cancer progression takes place. If targeted cancer therapies emerge, it will become crucially important to identify BRCA carriers at the time of diagnosis for optimal therapy and to identify unaffected carriers for chemoprevention. If so, then to the extent that barriers in the recognition and referral of patients to genetic counseling cannot be surmounted, pathological and genomic methods to identify a BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer profile will gain increasing clinical importance."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10091212", "_score": 408.43762, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Spain [D013030:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 [D002882:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Exons [D005091:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]"], "text": "[The identification of a new mutation in the BRCA2 gene by protein truncation analysis in a Spanish family with hereditary breast cancer].\n\n\nThe BRCA2 mutations are implicated in a high percentage of hereditary breast cancer cases.

However, only about 20% of familial breast cancer is attributed to mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, while a further 5-10% are attributed to mutations in other rare susceptibility genes such as TP53, STK11, PTEN, ATM and CHEK2. Despite extensive efforts to explain the missing heritability of this disease, the majority of familial clustering in breast cancer remains largely unexplained. We aim to analyze the pathology of familial cases of which no pathogenic mutation is yet identified.\n\nMETHODS: We compared the pathological phenotype of BRCA1/BRCA2 negative familial breast cancer (BRCAx) to BRCA1-positive, BRCA2-positive and sporadic cases without a family history. Age-adjusted analysis is summarized in odd's ratios and confidence intervals for tumor type, grade, lymph node, ER and HER2 status.\n\nRESULTS: We found non-familial cases to be more likely to be ER positive (P = 0.041) as compared with BRCAx tumors. More cases of lobular carcinoma were found with BRCAx as compared to BRCA1 tumors (P = 0.05). After multivariate logistic regression analysis, BRCAx tumors are more likely ER positive (P = 0.001) and HER2 positive (P = 0.047) in comparison to BRCA1. Conversely, BRCAx cases are less likely to be ER positive (P = 0.02) but more likely to be HER2 positive (P = 0.021) as compared with BRCA2 tumors.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAx tumors differ in phenotype from non-familial and familial BRCA1-positive and BRCA2-positive tumors.

An empirical method, the Manchester scoring system, has been elaborated for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation identification. We propose a general scoring system based on a transformation of the carriage probability. Up to an approximation, the transformed carriage probability becomes an additive score. We applied this new scoring system to the diagnosis of BRCA1-associated and BRCA2-associated breast-ovarian cancer predisposition. Using simulations, its performance was evaluated and compared with that of the Manchester scoring system and of the exact probability. Finally, the score system was used on a sample of 4563 families screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\nRESULTS: The performance of the new scoring system was superior to the Manchester scoring system, but the probability computation remained the most predictive. The better performance of the new scoring system was attributed to accounting for unaffected family members and for the degree of kinship of relatives with the proband.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The new scoring system has a theoretical basis and may be applied to any cancer family syndrome and, more generally, to any disease with monogenic subentities, in which the causal gene mutations have been identified.

Family history of breast and ovarian cancers suggestive of hereditary condition (at least 2 first- or second-degree relatives affected with breast cancer or at least 1 relative affected with ovarian cancer or early-onset breast cancer) was absent for 5 of 9 MUT carriers. This suggests that BRCA screening policies based on family history of cancer would miss a considerable proportion of BRCA mutations. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes explain at least 10% of breast cancer cases diagnosed before age 40 years. The contribution of these genes to early-onset breast cancer is likely to be even higher given that certain UV cases might be disease-associated."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15070707", "_score": 407.95404, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Acute Disease [D000208:minor]", "Fanconi Anemia [D005199:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Infant [D007223:minor]", "Leukemia [D007938:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Adolescent [D000293:minor]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Alleles [D000483:minor]", "Base Sequence [D001483:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Child [D002648:minor]", "Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]", "DNA, Complementary [D018076:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]"], "text": "Germline mutations in BRCA2: shared genetic susceptibility to breast cancer, early onset leukemia, and Fanconi anemia.\n\n\nThe breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 has recently been identified as identical to the Fanconi anemia (FA) gene FANCD1.

Most BRCA1 carcinomas have the basal cell phenotype, a subtype of high-grade, highly proliferating, estrogen receptor- and HER2-negative breast carcinomas, characterized by the expression of basal or myoepithelial markers such as basal keratins, P-cadherin, epidermal growth factor receptor, etc. This phenotype is rarely found in BRCA2 carcinomas, which are of higher grade than sporadic age-matched controls, but tend to be estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-positive. The expression of the cell-cycle proteins cyclins A, B1 and E and SKP2 is associated with a BRCA1 phenotype, whereas cyclin D1 and p27 expression is associated with BRCA2 carcinomas. Recent studies have shown that hereditary carcinomas that are not attributable to BRCA1/2 mutations have phenotypic similarities to BRCA2 tumors, but tend to be of lower grade and proliferation index. Somatic mutations in the BRCA genes are rarely found in hereditary tumors; by contrast, BRCA1 and BRCA2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is found in almost all BRCA1 and BRCA2 carcinomas, respectively. Furthermore, all types of hereditary breast carcinomas have a low frequency of HER2 expression. Finally, comparative genomic hybridization studies have revealed differences in chromosomal gains and losses between genotypes. The pathological and molecular features of hereditary breast cancer can drive specific treatments and influence the process of mutation screening.

One hundred forty-seven asymptomatic carriers underwent bilateral mastectomy and 107 symptomatic women had contralateral mastectomy after a mean cancer free interval of 3.6 years. All removed breasts were histopathologically examined.\n\nRESULTS: In one asymptomatic BRCA2 carrier (0.7%) an occult small invasive breast cancer was diagnosed, while in 6 asymptomatic carriers (4.0% BRCA1 and 4.3% BRCA2) and in 5 symptomatic carriers (2.5% BRCA1 and 10.7% BRCA2) DCIS was detected at prophylactic mastectomy. No breast cancer occurred in the asymptomatic group after a postprophylactic follow-up period of 778 women-years. In the symptomatic carriers 1 invasive breast cancer was detected after 580 follow-up years. From age-, cohort-, and gene-specific reference data we calculated that 15 invasive first cancers in the asymptomatic carriers were prevented during follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSION: One invasive breast cancer in 147 bilateral prophylactic mastectomies (0.7%) was detected, this makes a sentinel node procedure redundant and preoperative imaging vital. The prophylactic procedure is highly effective in preventing invasive breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

The most frequent mutations in BRCA1 were the c.187_188delAG, c.2080delA and the c.3889_3890delAG, whereas for BRCA2 the mutations with higher prevalence was observed for c.9254_9258delATCAT and the c.9204delCATCAGATTTATAT. We detected 5 pathogenic mutations (p.Y1429X in BRCA1 and c.1835insT, c.5025delT, c.6722delT and p.Q3156X in BRCA2) not reported in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database. Among them, the BRCA2 mutations c.1835insT and c.5025delT were recurrent and seemed to be characteristic of the population the Valencian Community.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We detected pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 34.0% of the families studied. The mutations c.1835insT and c.5025delT were 2 new recurrent pathogenic mutations in BRCA2 that seemed to be characteristic of the population of the Valencian Community.

Since un- or misrepaired DSB lead to chromosomal anomalies which may promote the development of breast cancer, we have studied the potential of mammography X-rays for immediate and delayed induction of chromosomal anomalies in human primary fibroblasts from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary human fibroblasts from three BRCA1, three BRCA2 mutation carriers, one BRCA2-deficient fanconi anemia (FA) patient and three normal individuals were exposed to various doses of mammography X-rays. Chromosomal anomalies at first mitosis and at several population doublings post-irradiation were assayed (Giemsa staining and Fish [fluorescence in situ hybridization]).\n\nRESULTS: No effect of the BRCA mutation status was observed on survival curves after exposure to mammography X-rays and on the dose-dependent increase of chromosomal anomalies at first mitosis post-irradiation. In contrast, several population doublings after exposure to a low dose of only 0.5 Gy chromosomal instability, manifested as gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy, had developed in BRCA2-deficient FA fibroblasts and in some - but not all - BRCA heterozygous fibroblasts.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Low doses of mammography X-rays have the potential to induce chromosomal instability in fibroblasts from BRCA mutation carriers: Cells exhibit gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidy similar to those observed in breast cancer cells. These results suggest that for women carrying a BRCA mutation early and frequent screening with mammography X-rays may not be the method of choice to detect breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11899391", "_score": 407.34952, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genetic Counseling [D005817:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Medical History Taking [D008487:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Ontario [D009864:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Age Distribution [D017677:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Prevalence [D015995:minor]", "Registries [D012042:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Alcoholism [D000437:minor]/complications [Q000150:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in male breast cancer patients in Canada.\n\n\nMen who inherit a mutation in the BRCA2 gene carry a 6% risk of developing breast cancer by the age of 70.

Most women with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer have tumors characterized by alterations in particular genes, mainly BRCA1 and BRCA2, but also CHK2, ATM, STK11 and others. This paper examines the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, focusing on the Italian pattern of mutations. The function of these two genes, classified as tumor suppressors, is linked with key metabolic mechanisms such as DNA damage repair, regulation of gene expression and cell cycle control. The pathological BRCA allelic variants may cause alteration of protein function, transcriptional activity and DNA repair; accumulation of the defects leads to widespread chromosome instability that may be directly responsible for cancer formation. In fact, mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, conferring a highly increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, do not lead to cancer by themselves. The current consensus is that these are 'caretaker' genes, which, when inactivated, allow other genetic defects to accumulate. The nature of these other molecular events may define the pathway through which BRCA1 and BRCA2 act. The BRCA mutation spectrum is complex, and the significance of most nucleotide alterations is difficult to understand. Moreover, the mutation pattern seems to be related to ethnicity. The Italian Consortium of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer has reviewed 1758 families; 23% have been found to be carriers of pathogenetic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Founder mutations have been described in geographically restricted areas of Italy; a regional founder effect has been demonstrated in Italy for the mutations BRCA1 5083del19 and BRCA2 8765delAG, and a probable new founder mutation has been characterized in Tuscany. The presence of founder mutations has practical implications for genetic testing."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10550129", "_score": 407.12482, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]", "Heterozygote [D006579:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "Breast cancer in carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations: tackling a molecular and clinical conundrum."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "16205630", "_score": 407.09094, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex [D046988:minor]", "Proteins [D011506:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "RNA, Small Interfering [D034741:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Blotting, Western [D015153:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "DNA Damage [D004249:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genomic Instability [D042822:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Methyl Methanesulfonate [D008741:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Mutagens [D009153:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]"], "text": "DSS1 is required for the stability of BRCA2.\n\n\nDSS1 is an evolutionarily conserved acidic protein that binds to BRCA2. However, study of the function of DSS1 in mammalian cells has been hampered because endogenous DSS1 has not been detectable by Western blotting. Here, we developed a modified Western blotting protocol that detects endogenous DSS1 protein, and used it to study the function of DSS1 and its interaction with BRCA2 in mammalian cells. We found that essentially all BRCA2 in human cell lines is associated with DSS1. Importantly, we found that RNAi knockdown of DSS1 in human cell lines led to dramatic loss of BRCA2 protein, mainly due to its increased degradation. Furthermore, the stability of BRCA2 mutant devoid of the DSS1-binding domain is unaffected by the depletion of DSS1. Most notably, like BRCA2 depletion, DSS1 depletion also led to hypersensitivity to DNA damage. These results demonstrated that the stability of BRCA2 protein in mammalian cells depends on the presence of DSS1. Deletion or mutation of DSS1 or suppression of its expression by other mechanisms are therefore potential causative mechanisms for human breast and ovarian cancer.

Breast self-examination appears to be a valuable additional detection method especially for BRCA1 carriers, who are at risk of developing a highly proliferating breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "21565612", "_score": 406.7343, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]", "Genomic Instability [D042822:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Sequence Alignment [D016415:minor]", "Animals [D000818:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Cell Line [D002460:minor]", "Cell Survival [D002470:minor]", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded [D053903:major]", "DNA Repair [D004260:minor]", "DNA Replication [D004261:major]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]"], "text": "Double-strand break repair-independent role for BRCA2 in blocking stalled replication fork degradation by MRE11.\n\n\nBreast cancer suppressor BRCA2 is critical for maintenance of genomic integrity and resistance to agents that damage DNA or collapse replication forks, presumably through homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks (HDR). Using single-molecule DNA fiber analysis, we show here that nascent replication tracts created before fork stalling with hydroxyurea are degraded in the absence of BRCA2 but are stable in wild-type cells. BRCA2 mutational analysis reveals that a conserved C-terminal site involved in stabilizing RAD51 filaments, but not in loading RAD51 onto DNA, is essential for this fork protection but dispensable for HDR. RAD51 filament disruption in wild-type cells phenocopies BRCA2 deficiency. BRCA2 prevents chromosomal aberrations on replication stalling, which are alleviated by inhibition of MRE11, the nuclease responsible for this form of fork instability.

Risk estimates for a population are possible if the mutation status of a representative sample of that population can be assessed.

BRCA2 localized to the telomeres in S phase in an ATR-dependent manner, and its absence resulted in the accumulation of common fragile sites, particularly at the G-rich lagging strand, and increased the telomere sister chromatid exchange in unchallenged cells. The incidence of common fragile sites and telomere sister chromatid exchange increased markedly after treatment with replication inhibitors.

RAD51 foci also appear during S phase and are thought to be required for the restart of stalled or broken replication forks. The RAD51 recombinase interacts directly with the breast cancer-associated tumour suppressor BRCA2, an interaction that is required for normal recombination proficiency, radiation resistance and genome stability. In CAPAN-1 cells, which express a truncated form of BRCA2 that is cytoplasmic because of loss of the nuclear localization signal, the formation of IR-induced RAD51 foci is impaired. In this work, we show that S-phase RAD51 foci form normally in CAPAN-1 cells expressing truncated BRCA2. Moreover, we find that RAD51 specifically associates with chromatin at S phase in a reaction that is BRCA2-independent. The observed BRCA2-dependent and independent formation of RAD51 foci shows that intact BRCA2 is not required for RAD51 focus formation per se, leading us to suggest that S phase and IR-induced RAD51 foci assemble by distinct pathways with defined protein requirements."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10356923", "_score": 405.07846, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:major]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "[The role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in hereditary breast cancer].\n\n\nFrom 5% to 10% of breast cancer cases result from an inherited predisposition.

BRCA2 has been shown to play a direct role in the repair of DNA by homologous recombination, by interacting with the Rad51 protein and facilitating the formation of Rad51 aggregates at the site of DNA damage. It likely plays a similar role when double strand breaks are created in the course of normal DNA replication; the absence of BRCA2 results in chromosomal instability, which is likely secondary to the defect in DNA repair. In the absence of BRCA2, the cell is more dependent on residual repair via Rad52, which makes Rad52 a target for therapy in BRCA-deficient tumors. BRCA1 plays a role in sensing DNA damage and replication stress and mediating the signaling responses. Therefore, in addition to its role in mediating DNA repair by homologous recombination via BRCA2, it can also signal cell cycle checkpoints and mediate other transcriptional responses to DNA damage. We have argued that the mechanism of cancer susceptibility from BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency is mediated via the defect in homologous recombination, since it is the main feature they share in common. We and others have recently demonstrated that the defect in homologous recombination changes the drug sensitivity profile, rendering the BRCA-deficient breast cancers sensitive to MitomycinC, cisplatin, etoposide and other drugs that produce complex double-stranded lesions in DNA. Furthermore, they show resistance to taxanes and navelbine. Fanconi anemia defective cells also show sensitivity to the same class of drugs, although their defect in homologous recombination in response to strand breaks appears less marked than in BRCA-deficient cells. However, Fanconi anemia cells also show chromosomal fragility, and appear to have defects in maintenance of the replication fork. Therefore, knowledge of whether this specific DNA repair pathway of homologous recombination is defective in breast cancer cells would be valuable information in planning optimized individual therapy. We have developed techniques to measure the functional integrity of homologous recombination in human breast cancers. Core biopsy samples are obtained and immediately irradiated ex vivo, allowing 3-4 hours for the appearance of Rad51, BRCA1 and FancD2 foci. Thin sections are obtained, permeabilized and stained by immunofluorescent techniques. We have identified tumors with defects in the ability to form Rad51 and BRCA1 foci, where there is no known genetic predisposition, implying that this BRCA-dependent repair pathway may be inactivated in sporadic as well as familial breast cancers. Thus, functional assays of homologous recombination could become a useful technique to determine phenotype of human breast cancer, which in turn will influence the choice of therapy."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10966850", "_score": 404.95035, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Animals [D000818:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Mice [D051379:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "DNA Repair [D004260:minor]", "Disease Models, Animal [D004195:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]"], "text": "Hereditary breast cancer: a review.\n\n\nBreast cancer is the most common female malignancy and a major cause of death in middle-aged women.

In sporadic breast cancer, tumours from premenopausal patients have been shown to differ from those of postmenopausal patients, but this phenomenon has been little studied among familial patients.\n\nMETHODS: Representative areas of all available breast cancer tissue specimens (n = 262) from 25 BRCA1, 20 BRCA2, and 74 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families were punched into a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemical staining of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, ERBB2, and p53 as well as the histology and grade of tumours in these three groups of families were studied in different age groups and compared with each other.\n\nRESULTS: We found that only breast cancers from young (<50 years) BRCA1+ patients represent features documented as being typical of BRCA1-associated cancers, such as high tumour grade, negativity for oestrogen and progesterone receptors, and overexpression of p53. Among the BRCA2 families, the opposite was found, with a significantly higher frequency of tumours negative for oestrogen and progesterone receptors among the older patients than among the other groups, but no distinctive tumour characteristics among the younger BRCA2 patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: Tumours of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers aged 50 years or more differed significantly from those of younger carriers. This difference may reflect different biological behaviour and pathways of tumour development among the older and the younger BRCA1 and BRCA2 patients, with impact also on prognosis and survival."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20010525", "_score": 404.31906, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Aged [D000368:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]", "Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]", "Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length [D012150:minor]", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide [D020641:minor]", "Receptors, Estrogen [D011960:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Receptors, Progesterone [D011980:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast [D018270:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Genotype [D005838:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Association between polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene and clinical parameters in breast cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: A C/T transition - rs4987117 (the Thr1915Met polymorphism) and an A/G transition - rs11571653 (the Met784Val polymorphism) in the BRCA2 gene were linked to breast cancer risk in Polish and Japanese populations, respectively.\n\nAIM: To study the association between polymorphisms of the BRCA2 gene and clinical parameters in breast cancer.\n\nMETHODS: Both polymorphisms were evaluated by RFLP - PCR in blood samples obtained from 117 women with sporadic breast cancer.

Here, we report that PALB2, the partner and localizer of BRCA2, binds directly to BRCA1, and serves as the molecular scaffold in the formation of the BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. The association between BRCA1 and PALB2 is primarily mediated via apolar bonding between their respective coiled-coil domains. More importantly, BRCA1 mutations identified in cancer patients disrupted the specific interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2. Consistent with the converging functions of the BRCA proteins in DNA repair, cells harboring mutations with abrogated BRCA1-PALB2 interaction resulted in defective homologous recombination (HR) repair. We propose that, via its direct interaction with PALB2, BRCA1 fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks.

We have reconstituted PALB2-deficient cells with PALB2Delta1-70, PALB2-L21P, or PALB2-L24P, or with COOH-terminally truncated PALB2 that is deficient for interaction with BRCA2. Using extracts from these cells, we find that PALB2 mediates the physical interaction of BRCA2 with a COOH-terminal fragment of BRCA1. Analysis of the assembly of foci in these cells by BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2, and RAD51 suggests that BRCA1 recruits PALB2, which in turn organizes BRCA2 and RAD51. Resistance to mitomycin C and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination require the interaction of PALB2 with both BRCA1 and BRCA2. These results suggest that BRCA1 and BRCA2 cooperate in DNA damage responses in a PALB2-dependent manner, and have important implications for the genesis of breast/ovarian cancer and for chemotherapy with DNA interstrand cross-linking agents."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11072151", "_score": 404.0639, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Radiation Tolerance [D011836:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "Mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 cancer predisposition genes in radiation hypersensitive cancer patients.\n\n\nPURPOSE: The dose intensity of radiotherapy (RT) used in cancer treatment is limited in rare individuals who display severe normal tissue reactions after standard RT treatments. Novel predictive assays are required to identify these individuals prior to treatment. The mechanisms responsible for such reactions are unknown, but may involve dysfunction of genes involved in the sensing and response of cells to DNA damage. The breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are implicated in DNA damage repair and the control of genome stability. The purpose of this study was to determine if clinical radiation hypersensitivity is related to mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

FANCD2-Ub then promotes BRCA2 loading into a chromatin complex. FANCD2(-/-) cells are deficient in the assembly of DNA damage-inducible BRCA2 foci and in chromatin loading of BRCA2. Functional complementation with the FANCD2 cDNA restores BRCA2 foci and its chromatin loading following DNA damage. BRCA2(-/-) cells expressing a carboxy-terminal truncated BRCA2 protein form IR-inducible BRCA2 and FANCD2 foci, but these foci fail to colocalize. Functional complementation of these cells with wild-type BRCA2 restores the interaction of BRCA2 and FANCD2. The C terminus of BRCA2 is therefore required for the functional interaction of BRCA2 and FANCD2 in chromatin.

Tumor and paired normal tissue sample from 175 patients unselected for family history or age were taken after mastectomy for breast cancer and evaluated. There were 20 mutations of BRCA2 gene in exon 11 in 15 cases (15/175, 8.6%). Most mutations we identified were point mutation (19/20, 95%), except for one nucleotide insertion.

Risk reduction strategies are discussed after assessment of risk factors for developing contralateral breast cancer. We assessed potential risk factors that could be of use in clinical practice, including the novel use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) testing. 506 BRCA1 and 505 BRCA2 mutation carriers with a diagnosis of breast cancer were observed for up to 30 years. The risk of a contralateral breast cancer is approximately 2-3% per year, remaining constant for at least 20 years. This was similar in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers. Initial breast cancer before age 40-years was a significant risk factor, which was more pronounced in BRCA1 patients. The effect of risk-reducing oophorectomy on contralateral breast cancer risk may be overestimated because of bias. No significant association was found between overall breast cancer risk SNP score and contralateral breast cancer development. Young mutation carriers, particularly those with BRCA1 mutations, who develop breast cancer have a significantly higher risk of developing contralateral breast cancer, remaining constant for over 20 years.

We conducted a multi-center study to characterize the spectra of BRCA mutations in Chinese breast and ovarian cancer patients from Southern China.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 651 clinically high-risk breast and/or ovarian cancer patients were recruited from the Hong Kong Hereditary Breast Cancer Family Registry from 2007 to 2011. Comprehensive BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screening was performed using bi-directional sequencing of all coding exons of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Sequencing results were confirmed by in-house developed full high resolution DNA melting (HRM) analysis. Among the 451 probands analyzed, 69 (15.3%) deleterious BRCA mutations were identified, comprising 29 in BRCA1 and 40 in BRCA2. The four recurrent BRCA1 mutations (c.470_471delCT, c.3342_3345delAGAA, c.5406+1_5406+3delGTA and c.981_982delAT) accounted for 34.5% (10/29) of all BRCA1 mutations in this cohort.

Higher risks for various cancer types in the general Ontario population were associated with BRCA1 mutation carriage than with noncarriage, including ovarian (RR = 21, 95% CI = 12 to 36), female breast (RR = 11, 95% CI = 7.5 to 15), and testis (RR = 17, 95% CI = 1.3 to 230) cancers. Higher risks were also associated with BRCA2 mutation carriage than with noncarriage, particularly for ovarian (RR = 7.0, 95% CI = 3.1 to 16), female and male breast (RR = 4.6, 95% CI = 2.7 to 7.8, and RR = 102, 95% CI = 9.9 to 1050, respectively), and pancreatic (RR = 6.6, 95% CI = 1.9 to 23) cancers. Cancer risks differed according to the mutation's position in the gene. Estimated cumulative incidence to age 80 years among women carrying BRCA1 mutations was 24% for ovarian cancer and 90% for breast cancer and among women carrying BRCA2 mutations was 8.4% for ovarian cancer and 41% for breast cancer. For the general Ontario population, estimated carrier frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively, were 0.32% (95% CI = 0.23% to 0.45%) and 0.69% (95% CI = 0.43% to 1.10%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be more frequent in general populations than previously thought and may be associated with various types of cancers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15994883", "_score": 401.80725, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Incidence [D015994:minor]", "Jews [D007585:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Meta-Analysis as Topic [D015201:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Penetrance [D019683:minor]", "Prevalence [D015995:minor]", "Risk Assessment [D018570:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Founder Effect [D018703:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Heterozygote [D006579:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Breast and ovarian cancer risks to carriers of the BRCA1 5382insC and 185delAG and BRCA2 6174delT mutations: a combined analysis of 22 population based studies.\n\n\nA recent report estimated the breast cancer risks in carriers of the three Ashkenazi founder mutations to be higher than previously published estimates derived from population based studies.

BRCA1 was localized to chromosome 17 through analysis of a set of high-risk kindreds (2), and then identified four years later by a positional cloning strategy (3). BRCA2 was mapped to chromosomal 13q at about the same time (4). Just fifteen months later, Wooster et al. (5) reported a partial BRCA2 sequence and six mutations predicted to cause truncation of the BRCA2 protein. While these findings provide strong evidence that the identified gene corresponds to BRCA2, only two thirds of the coding sequence and 8 out of 27 exons were isolated and screened; consequently, several questions remained unanswered regarding the nature of BRCA2 and the frequency of mutations in 13q-linked families. We have now determined the complete coding sequence and exonic structure of BRCA2 (GenBank accession #U43746), and examined its pattern of expression. Here, we provide sequences for a set of PCR primers sufficient to screen the entire coding sequence of BRCA2 using genomic DNA.

BRCA2-mutated families presented breast and ovarian cancers or breast cancers only, whereas most BRCA1-mutated families presented ovarian cancer alone or in association with breast cancer. All the BRCA2 mutations led to a truncated protein: 6 were frameshift mutations, 4 were non-sense mutations and 2 involved the intronic invariant region leading to splice variants. Therefore, in the Italian population, the cumulative proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was within the range observed in other studies (37%), with higher involvement of BRCA2 than of BRCA1.

However, only a paucity of data exists on the pathology of breast cancers (BCs) in men with BRCA1/2 mutations. Using the largest available dataset, we determined whether MBCs arising in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers display specific pathologic features and whether these features differ from those of BRCA1/2 female BCs (FBCs).\n\nMETHODS: We characterised the pathologic features of 419 BRCA1/2 MBCs and, using logistic regression analysis, contrasted those with data from 9675 BRCA1/2 FBCs and with population-based data from 6351 MBCs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.\n\nRESULTS: Among BRCA2 MBCs, grade significantly decreased with increasing age at diagnosis (P = 0.005). Compared with BRCA2 FBCs, BRCA2 MBCs were of significantly higher stage (P for trend = 2 \u00d7 10(-5)) and higher grade (P for trend = 0.005) and were more likely to be oestrogen receptor-positive [odds ratio (OR) 10.59; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5.15-21.80] and progesterone receptor-positive (OR 5.04; 95 % CI 3.17-8.04).

Long-term safety of AG014699 was assessed.\n\nRESULTS: AG014699 (\u226410 \u03bcM) was cytotoxic to cells with mutated BRCA1/2 or XRCC3 and to UACC3199 cells with epigenetically silenced BRCA1 but not to cells without BRCA1/2 or XRCC3 mutations or that were heterozygous for BRCA2 mutation. AG014699 induced DNA double-strand breaks in all nine cell lines studied. HRR was observed only in cells with functional BRCA1/2 proteins. Growth of xenograft tumors with BRCA1/2 mutations or with epigenetically silenced BRCA1 was reduced by AG014699 treatment, and combination treatment with AG014699 plus carboplatin was more effective than either drug alone. AG014699 was not toxic in mice with nonmutated or heterozygous BRCA2.\n\nCONCLUSION: Human cancer cells or xenograft tumors with mutated or epigenetically silenced BRCA1/2 were sensitive to AG014699 monotherapy, indicating a potential role for PARP inhibitors in sporadic human cancers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10551859", "_score": 401.31824, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]", "Green Fluorescent Proteins [D049452:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Luminescent Proteins [D008164:minor]", "Microscopy, Fluorescence [D008856:minor]", "Mitosis [D008938:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Protein Binding [D011485:minor]", "Rad51 Recombinase [D051135:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid [D012091:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "S Phase [D016196:minor]", "Tetracycline [D013752:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]", "Cell Cycle [D002453:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:major]", "Clone Cells [D002999:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:minor]", "DNA Damage [D004249:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "G2 Phase [D016195:minor]", "Gamma Rays [D005720:minor]"], "text": "Expression of BRC repeats in breast cancer cells disrupts the BRCA2-Rad51 complex and leads to radiation hypersensitivity and loss of G(2)/M checkpoint control.\n\n\nBRCA2 is a breast tumor suppressor with a potential function in the cellular response to DNA damage.

Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated to examine the association between family history of breast cancer and risk of asynchronous CBC. Age- and family history-specific 10-year cumulative absolute risks of CBC were estimated.\n\nRESULTS: Family history of breast cancer was associated with increased CBC risk; risk was highest among young women (< 45 years) with first-degree relatives affected at young ages (< 45 years; RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 5.3) or women with first-degree relatives with bilateral disease (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.4).

This risk varies with diagnosis age, family history of CBC, and degree of relationship to an affected relative.

To study the role of Brca2 specifically in mammary epithelium development, we crossed mice bearing the conditionally deficient allele Brca2(flox9-10) to mouse mammary tumor virus- or whey acidic protein-Cre transgenic lines. Analysis of these animals showed that Brca2 is not required for epithelial expansion in mammary glands of pregnant mice. In addition, examination of mammary gland involution revealed normal kinetics of mammary alveolar cell apoptosis after weaning of litters. Nevertheless, Brca2-deficient mice developed mammary adenocarcinomas after a long latency (average, 1.6 years). Detailed histopathological analysis of four of these tumors demonstrated that three of them showed abnormal p53 protein expression. A mutation in the p53 gene was detected in one case. Moreover, homozygosity versus heterozygosity for the Brca2 mutation heavily skewed the tumor spectrum toward mammary adenocarcinoma development in p53(+/-) mice.

Multiple studies have confirmed that BRCA1-associated HBC (BRCA1-HBC) generally exhibit a specific phenotype that is characterized by high tumor grade and estrogen receptor negativity.

The differentially expressed genes include a prominent cluster of genes from chromosomes 13 and 14 whose expression is reduced. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed that genes in specific bands on 13q and 14q showed significantly reduced expression, suggesting that the affected bands may be preferentially deleted in BRCA2-mutant tumors. Genomic profiling showed that the BRCA2-mutant tumors indeed harbor deletions on chromosomes 13q and 14q. To exploit this information we have created a simple fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test and shown that it detects tumors with deletions on chromosomes 13q and 14q.\n\nCONCLUSION: Together with previous reports, this establishes that deletions on chromosomes 13q and 14q are a hallmark of BRCA2-mutant tumors.

Because mammary gland cells divide and differentiate during pregnancy, reproductive factors may influence breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers differently than they do in noncarriers.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1601 women in the International BRCA1/2 Carrier Cohort Study cohort, all of whom carried a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2.

However, comparison of the mammalian and chicken sequences revealed remarkably high homology in several segments.

The cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer was also studied in genetically determined breast cancer syndrome subjects with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and compared with the general population.\n\nMETHODS: Subjects included 42 patients with colorectal cancer from 32 clinically determined hereditary breast cancer kindreds based on the autosomal dominant inheritance of breast cancers and early age of onset. The general population colorectal cancer cohort was composed of 755 patients from a tumor registry. Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer was determined in 164 BRCA1 and 88 BRCA2 gene mutation carriers and compared with the general population. Mean age of colorectal cancer onset, anatomic site distribution, histologic stage at presentation, and five year stage-stratified survival rates were compared between clinically determined hereditary breast cancer family members and the general population.\n\nRESULTS: The lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in male BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers was 5.6 percent, which was not different from 6 percent in males from the general population. Likewise, the lifetime colorectal cancer risk in female BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers was 3.2 percent, which was not different from 5.9 percent in females from the general population. Mean age of onset +/- standard error for patients with colorectal cancer was 60 +/- 2 years for hereditary breast cancer kindreds compared with 67 +/- 0.4 years for the general population (P = 0.0004). Colorectal cancer site distribution did not vary between hereditary breast cancer and the general population. Overall colorectal cancer stage distribution was significantly different, with more Stage I and fewer Stage IV cancers in subjects with hereditary breast cancer compared with the general population (P = 0.01). Overall five year stage-stratified colorectal cancer survival rate +/- standard error was 66 +/- 8 percent for hereditary breast cancer kindreds and 46 +/- 2 percent for the general population (P = 0.023).\n\nCONCLUSION: Lifetime cumulative colorectal cancer incidence in subjects with BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations was not different from the general population. However, significant differences in colorectal cancer were noted between hereditary breast cancer family members and the general population. Hereditary breast cancer-associated colorectal cancer had an earlier age of onset, lower tumor stage, and better survival rate than the general population.

However, nothing is yet known about the involvement of BRCA2 in hypoxic conditions in breast cancer. Initially, a cell proliferation assay allowed us to hypothesize that hypoxia could negatively regulate the breast cancer cell growth in short term in vitro studies. Subsequently, we analyzed gene expression in breast cancer cell lines exposed to hypoxic condition by microarray analysis. Interestingly, genes involved in DNA damage repair pathways such as mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination repair were downregulated. In particular, we focused on the BRCA2 downregulation which was confirmed at mRNA and protein level. In addition, breast cancer cells were treated with dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a cell-permeable inhibitor of both proline and asparaginyl hydroxylases able to induce HIF-1 \u03b1 stabilization in normoxia, providing results comparable to those previously described.

Predictions of genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer for 301 individuals were made using BRCAPRO, a statistical model and software using Mendelian genetics and Bayesian updating. Model predictions were compared with the results of genetic testing.\n\nRESULTS: Among the test individuals, 126 were Ashkenazi Jewish, three were male subjects, 243 had breast cancer, 49 had ovarian cancer, 34 were unaffected, and 139 tested positive for BRCA1 mutations and 29 for BRCA2 mutations. BRCAPRO performed well: for the 150 probands with the smallest BRCAPRO carrier probabilities (average, 29.0%), the proportion testing positive was 32.7%; for the 151 probands with the largest carrier probabilities (average, 95.2%), 78.8% tested positive.

Since the combined frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations exceeds 2 percent among Ashkenazi Jews, we were able to estimate the risk of cancer in a large group of Jewish men and women from the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nMETHODS: We collected blood samples from 5318 Jewish subjects who had filled out epidemiologic questionnaires. Carriers of the 185delAG and 5382insC mutations in BRCA1 and the 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 were identified with assays based on the polymerase chain reaction. We estimated the risks of breast and other cancers by comparing the cancer histories of relatives of carriers of the mutations and noncarriers.\n\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation were identified. By the age of 70, the estimated risk of breast cancer among carriers was 56 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 40 to 73 percent); of ovarian cancer, 16 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 28 percent); and of prostate cancer, 16 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 30 percent). There were no significant differences in the risk of breast cancer between carriers of BRCA1 mutations and carriers of BRCA2 mutations, and the incidence of colon cancer among the relatives of carriers was not elevated.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Over 2 percent of Ashkenazi Jews carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that confer increased risks of breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer.

It has also been suggested that soy has a protective effect against breast cancer in Asia and, more particularly, phytoestrogens such as daidzein and genistein. Thus, phytoestrogens may have an impact on the expression of BRCA2 gene, and there is a possible link between BRCA2 and genes acting around the BRCA2. To focus on these processes, we set up the BRCA2 specific knockdown by RNA interference in two breast tumor cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and also in a non-tumorigenic breast cell line (MCF-10a). After inhibition of BRCA2 expression, cells were maintained in different conditions and treated with either daidzein or genistein or left untreated.

However, the majority of missense variants identified throughout the genes continue to pose an obstacle for predictive informative testing due to low frequency and lack of information on how they affect BRCA1/2 function. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 play an important role in their function as regulators of DNA repair, transcription and cell cycle in response to DNA damage but whether missense variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are able to disrupt this important process is not known. Here we employed a novel approach using NetworKIN which predicts in vivo kinase-substrate relationship, and evolutionary conservation algorithms SIFT, PolyPhen and Align-GVGD. We evaluated whether 191 BRCA1 and 43 BRCA2 VUS from the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database can functionally alter the consensus phosphorylation motifs and abolish kinase recognition and binding to sites known to be phosphorylated in vivo. Our results show that 13.09% (25/191) BRCA1 and 13.95% (6/43) BRCA2 VUS altered the phosphorylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2.

These occurred rarely (n<2 in BIC), mutated evolutionarily conserved residues and abolished kinase binding to motifs established in the literature involved in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, transcription or response to DNA damage. Additionally in vivo phosphorylation sites identified via through-put methods are also affected by VUS and are attractive targets for studying their biological and functional significance.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the prognostic value of BRCA2 status in male breast carcinoma (MBC).\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 43 male breast cancer patients, including 12 with BRCA2 mutations. Tumor samples were characterized immunohistochemically using antibodies to estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and androgen receptor (AR).\n\nRESULTS: BRCA2-related tumors presented at the earlier age compared with sporadic tumors (P = 0.005). Patients positive and negative for BRCA2 mutations did not differ with respect to tumor size, lymph node involvement, histological grade, and sex hormone receptor status.

Based in Australia, the primary aim of kConFab is to facilitate high-quality research by amassing a large and comprehensive resource of epidemiological and clinical data with biospecimens from individuals at high risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer, and from their close relatives.\n\nMETHODS: Epidemiological, family history and lifestyle data, as well as biospecimens, are collected from multiple-case breast cancer families ascertained through family cancer clinics in Australia and New Zealand. We used the Tyrer-Cuzick algorithms to assess the prospective risk of breast cancer in women in the kConFab cohort who were unaffected with breast cancer at the time of enrolment in the study.\n\nRESULTS: Of kConFab's first 822 families, 518 families had multiple cases of female breast cancer alone, 239 had cases of female breast and ovarian cancer, 37 had cases of female and male breast cancer, and 14 had both ovarian cancer as well as male and female breast cancer. Data are currently held for 11,422 people and germline DNAs for 7,389. Among the 812 families with at least one germline sample collected, the mean number of germline DNA samples collected per family is nine. Of the 747 families that have undergone some form of mutation screening, 229 (31%) carry a pathogenic or splice-site mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Germline DNAs and data are stored from 773 proven carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA1 mutations. kConFab's fresh tissue bank includes 253 specimens of breast or ovarian tissue--both normal and malignant--including 126 from carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\n\nCONCLUSION: These kConFab resources are available to researchers anywhere in the world, who may apply to kConFab for biospecimens and data for use in ethically approved, peer-reviewed projects. A high calculated risk from the Tyrer-Cuzick algorithms correlated closely with the subsequent occurrence of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation positive families, but this was less evident in families in which no pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has been detected."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20810374", "_score": 398.49768, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adolescent [D000293:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mastectomy [D008408:major]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:major]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Ovariectomy [D010052:major]", "Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Adult [D000328:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:major]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Cause of Death [D002423:minor]", "Fallopian Tubes [D005187:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Association of risk-reducing surgery in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers with cancer risk and mortality.\n\n\nCONTEXT: Mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are widely used by carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations to reduce their risks of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate risk and mortality reduction stratified by mutation and prior cancer status.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective, multicenter cohort study of 2482 women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations ascertained between 1974 and 2008. The study was conducted at 22 clinical and research genetics centers in Europe and North America to assess the relationship of risk-reducing mastectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy with cancer outcomes.

Six of the individual mutations are estimated to have arisen 400-2,000 years ago.

This hypersensitivity can be reversed by the expression of forms of BRCA1 that are not growth suppressing. Reversal of hypersensitivity requires the ring finger of BRCA1, its transactivation domain, and its BRCT domain. Lastly, we show that unlike BRCA2, BRCA1 does not function in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Instead, it functions in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). TCR ability correlated with radioresistance as cells containing BRCA1 showed both increased TCR and radioresistance, whereas cells without BRCA1 showed decreased TCR and radiosensitivity.

A BRCA2-classifier was built using array-CGH profiles of 28 BRCA2-mutated and 28 sporadic breast tumors. The classifier was validated on an independent group of 19 BRCA2-mutated and 19 sporadic breast tumors. Subsequently, we tested 89 breast tumors from suspected hereditary breast (and ovarian) cancer (HBOC) families, in which either no BRCA1/2 mutation or an UV had been found by routine diagnostics. The classifier showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 84% on the validation set of known BRCA2-mutation carriers and sporadic tumor cases. Of the 89 HBOC cases, 17 presented a BRCA2-like profile. In three of these cases additional indications for BRCA2-deficiency were found. Chromosomal aberrations that were specific for BRCA2-mutated tumors included loss on chromosome arm 13q and 14q, and gain on 17q. Since we could separate BRCA1-like, BRCA2-like, and sporadic-like tumors, using our current BRCA2- and previous BRCA1-classifier, this method of breast tumor classification could be applied as additional test for current diagnostics to help clinicians in decision making and classifying sequence variants of unknown significance."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17307353", "_score": 398.17044, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Prognosis [D011379:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]", "Chi-Square Distribution [D016009:minor]", "Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]", "Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]"], "text": "Tumour characteristics, survival and prognostic factors of hereditary breast cancer from BRCA2-, BRCA1- and non-BRCA1/2 families as compared to sporadic breast cancer cases.\n\n\nAIM OF THE STUDY: Results on tumour characteristics and survival of hereditary breast cancer (BC), especially on BRCA2-associated BC, are inconclusive. The prognostic impact of the classical tumour and treatment factors in hereditary BC is insufficiently known.\n\nMETHODS: We selected 103 BRCA2-, 223 BRCA1- and 311 non-BRCA1/2 BC patients (diagnosis 1980-2004) from the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic. To correct for longevity bias, analyses were also performed while excluding index patients undergoing DNA testing 2 years after BC diagnosis. As a comparison group, 759 sporadic BC patients of comparable age at and year of diagnosis were selected. We compared tumour characteristics, the occurrence of ipsilateral recurrence (LRR) and contralateral BC (CBC) as well as distant disease-free (DDFS), BC-specific (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) between these groups. By multivariate modelling, the prognostic impact of tumour and treatment factors was investigated separately in hereditary BC.\n\nRESULTS: We confirmed the presence of the particular BRCA1-phenotype. In contrast, tumour characteristics of BRCA2-associated BC were similar to those of non-BRCA1/2 and sporadic BC, with the exception of a high risk of CBC (3.1% per year) and oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positivity (83%). No significant differences between BRCA2-associated BC and other BC subgroups were found with respect to LRR, DDFS, BCSS and OS. Independent prognostic factors for BC-specific survival in hereditary BC (combining the three subgroups) were tumour stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, histologic grade, ER status and a prophylactic (salpingo-)oophorectomy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Apart from the frequent occurrence of contralateral BC and a positive ER-status, BRCA2-associated BC did not markedly differ from other hereditary or sporadic BC. Our observation that tumour size and nodal status are prognostic factors also in hereditary BC implies that the strategy to use these factors as a proxy for ultimate mortality appears to be valid also in this specific group of patients."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "24094589", "_score": 398.1576, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Base Sequence [D001483:minor]", "Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]", "Sensitivity and Specificity [D012680:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]", "Gene Frequency [D005787:minor]", "Gene Library [D015723:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome [D061325:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing [D059014:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "A clinically validated diagnostic second-generation sequencing assay for detection of hereditary BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\nIndividuals who inherit mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers.

This study examined whether mutation status influenced the rate of breast cancer recurrence following breast-conserving treatment. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were screened for germline mutations in 131 patients with a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, who had been treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. The 131 patients with familial history were matched to 261 patients without, according to age at diagnosis and year of treatment. The follow-up of controls was at least equal to the time-interval between diagnosis and genetic testing in familial cases. Matched cohorts were compared according to rates of breast cancer recurrence as first event and contralateral breast cancer using log-rank tests. BRCA1/2 mutations were found in 20.6% patients with a family history. Nineteen patients had a BRCA1 mutation and 8 had a BRCA2 mutation. Breast cancers in mutation carriers were more often grade III (p<10-4) and oestrogen receptor negative (p=0.005) than tumours in both non-carriers and controls. Median follow-up for all 392 patients was 8.75 years. No significant differences in breast cancer recurrence as first event were seen between BRCA1/2 tumours and controls (p=0.47), carriers and non-carriers with a family history (p=0.96), or non-carriers and controls (p=0.10). On multivariate analysis, age was the most important factor significantly predicting for breast cancer recurrence. The rate of contralateral breast cancer was significantly increased in all patients with a family history: BRCA1/2 carriers versus controls (p=0.0003), non-carriers versus controls (p=0.0034) and carriers versus non-carriers (p=0.02). At a 9-year median follow-up, the rate of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence was not higher in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers than in non-carriers with a family history or sporadic cases. These results support the hypothesis that breast tumours in BRCA carriers are more sensitive to radiation. Therefore, breast-conserving treatment can be offered to these patients.

The risk prediction algorithm BOADICEA (Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm) may be used to compute the probabilities of carrying mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and help to target mutation screening. Tumours from BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers display distinctive pathological features that could be used to better discriminate between BRCA1 mutation carriers, BRCA2 mutation carriers and noncarriers. In particular, oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative status, triple-negative (TN) status, and expression of basal markers are predictive of BRCA1 mutation carrier status.\n\nMETHODS: We extended BOADICEA by treating breast cancer subtypes as distinct disease end points. Age-specific expression of phenotypic markers in a series of tumours from 182 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 62 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 109 controls from the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium, and over 300,000 tumours from the general population obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results database, were used to calculate age-specific and genotype-specific incidences of each disease end point. The probability that an individual carries a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation given their family history and tumour marker status of family members was computed in sample pedigrees.\n\nRESULTS: The cumulative risk of ER-negative breast cancer by age 70 for BRCA1 mutation carriers was estimated to be 55% and the risk of ER-positive disease was 18%. The corresponding risks for BRCA2 mutation carriers were 21% and 44% for ER-negative and ER-positive disease, respectively. The predicted BRCA1 carrier probabilities among ER-positive breast cancer cases were less than 1% at all ages. For women diagnosed with breast cancer below age 50 years, these probabilities rose to more than 5% in ER-negative breast cancer, 7% in TN disease and 24% in TN breast cancer expressing both CK5/6 and CK14 cytokeratins. Large differences in mutation probabilities were observed by combining ER status and other informative markers with family history.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This approach combines both full pedigree and tumour subtype data to predict BRCA1/2 carrier probabilities. Prediction of BRCA1/2 carrier status, and hence selection of women for mutation screening, may be substantially improved by combining tumour pathology with family history of cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15917310", "_score": 397.14197, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA Damage [D004249:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 as ovarian cancer susceptibility genes.\n\n\nIndividuals carrying germline mutations in one allele of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are at significantly increased risk of developing cancer.

Here, we discuss existing knowledge of the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation in pre-disposition to ovarian cancer. The risk of an individual with a mutation developing cancer of the ovary appears to be influenced by the position of the mutation within the BRCA gene, the presence of allelic variants of modifying genes and the hormonal exposure of the carrier.

In Chinese population, BRCA1 mutations could explain a relatively large proportion of inherited breast cancer cases in comparison with BRCA2 mutations, which probably deduced a hypothesis that those genes involved in BRCA1-mediated DNA repair pathway might play a more significant role in the etiology of Chinese breast cancer. To investigate the contribution of BRIP1/BACH1 mutations to the predisposition of Chinese non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer, we screened all the coding exons and adjacent intronic splice junction regions of BRIP1/BACH1 in 357 Chinese women with early-onset breast cancer or affected relatives from five different breast disease clinical centers in China, using PCR-DHPLC and DNA sequencing analysis.

The novel alteration Q944E identified in our study possibly represents a rare disease-related allele, nevertheless functional analysis is still warranted to resolve the ability of this altered BACH1 protein to bind BRCA1.

Eleven FA genes have been identified, one of which, FANCD1, is the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2. At least eight FA proteins form a nuclear core complex required for monoubiquitination of FANCD2. The BRCA2/FANCD1 protein is connected to the FA pathway by interactions with the FANCG and FANCD2 proteins, both of which co-localise with the RAD51 recombinase, which is regulated by BRCA2. These connections raise the question of whether any of the FANC proteins of the core complex might also participate in other complexes involved in homologous recombination repair. We therefore tested known FA proteins for direct interaction with RAD51 and its paralogs XRCC2 and XRCC3. FANCG was found to interact with XRCC3, and this interaction was disrupted by the FA-G patient derived mutation L71P. FANCG was co-immunoprecipitated with both XRCC3 and BRCA2 from extracts of human and hamster cells. The FANCG-XRCC3 and FANCG-BRCA2 interactions did not require the presence of other FA proteins from the core complex, suggesting that FANCG also participates in a DNA repair complex that is downstream and independent of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. Additionally, XRCC3 and BRCA2 proteins co-precipitate in both human and hamster cells and this interaction requires FANCG. The FANCG protein contains multiple tetratricopeptide repeat motifs (TPRs), which function as scaffolds to mediate protein-protein interactions. Mutation of one or more of these motifs disrupted all of the known interactions of FANCG. We propose that FANCG, in addition to stabilising the FA core complex, may have a role in building multiprotein complexes that facilitate homologous recombination repair."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17972177", "_score": 396.86713, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Indonesia [D007214:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation analysis in the Indonesian population.\n\n\nSpecific mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been identified in specific populations and ethnic groups.

We evaluated 22 missense mutations from the BRCA2 DNA binding domain (DBD) that were identified in multiple breast cancer families using these assays and compared the results with those from the likelihood model. Thirteen variants inactivated BRCA2 function in at least one assay; two others truncated BRCA2 by aberrant splicing; and seven had no effect on BRCA2 function.

All subjects underwent genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were excluded. This cohort of 5 842 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer was classified as two groups: familial breast cancer patients (n=480) and sporadic breast cancer patients (n=5 362). The clinicalpathological data and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the 480 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer and the 5 362 patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer were compared retrospectively. Then the influencing factors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Among the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer patients, 4.4% of the patients were diagnosed before 30 years of age in the familial breast cancer group, significantly higher than that of 2.6% in the sporadic breast cancer group(P=0.020). 5.0% of the patients in the familial breast cancer group had bilateral breast cancer, significantly higher than that of 2.7% in the sporadic breast cancer group (P=0.004). Compared with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer patients, the relative risk of early-onset breast cancer (\u2264 30 years) and bilateral breast cancer were 1.73 and 1.91, respectively, significantly higher than that in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer cases (P=0.020 and P=0.004). 2 964 patients in this cohort of 5 842 case sreceived neoadjuvant chemotherapy.The pathologic complete response (pCR) rate was significantly higher in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer group than in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer group (21.7% vs. 14.0%, P=0.001). Independent factors associated with pCR in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative breast cancer patients were tumor size less than 2 cm (P=0.012), histologic grade \u2162 (P<0.001), triple-negative breast cancers (P<0.001), and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer(P=0.001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative sporadic breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-negative familial breast cancer is more likely diagnosed before the age of 30 years and has a higher risk to develop bilateral breast cancer.

Preventive bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended to women with a BRCA mutation at age 35 years or thereafter to prevent breast and ovarian cancer, but it is unclear whether oophorectomy has an impact on survival in women with BRCA-associated breast cancer.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of oophorectomy on survival in women with breast cancer with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective analysis of patients selected by pedigree review of families who received counseling at 1 of 12 participating clinical genetics centers. Patients were 676 women with stage I or II breast cancer and a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation who were observed for up to 20 years after receiving a diagnosis between 1975 and 2008.

The 20-year survival for the entire patient cohort was 77.4%. The adjusted hazard ratio for death attributed to breast cancer in women who underwent oophorectomy was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.19-0.77; P = .007) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.23-1.43; P = .23) for BRCA2 carriers.

This question has important implications for health policy and the design of epidemiologic studies. To establish the relative contributions of founder and nonfounder BRCA mutations, we established the entire spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a large set of breast-ovarian cancer families with origins in all regions of Poland. We sequenced the entire coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 100 Polish families with 3 or more cases of breast cancer and in 100 families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancer. A mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was detected in 66% of breast cancer families and in 63% of breast-ovarian cancer families. Of 129 mutations, 122 (94.6%) were in BRCA1 and 7 (5.4%) were in BRCA2. Of the 122 families with BRCA1 mutations, 119 (97.5%) had a recurrent mutation (i.e., one that was seen in at least 2 families). In particular, 111 families (91.0%) carried one of the 3 common founder mutations. The mutation spectrum was not different between families with and without ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that a rapid and inexpensive assay directed at identifying the 3 common founder mutations will have a sensitivity of 86% compared to a much more costly and labor-intensive full-sequence analysis of both genes.

Because DSS1, a mammalian component of the transcription/RNA export complex, is known to stabilize BRCA2, we investigated how the expression of DSS1 is associated with clinical parameters in breast cancers.\n\nMETHODS: DSS1 mRNA and p53 protein were examined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer specimens to classify DSS1(high) and DSS1(low) or p53(high) and p53(low) groups. Patient survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier method. DSS1(high) or DSS1(low) breast cancer cells were prepared by retroviral cDNA transfection or DSS1 siRNA on proliferation, cell cycle progression, and survival by flow cytometric analyses with or without anti-cancer drugs.\n\nRESULTS: In comparison to patients with low levels of DSS1, high-DSS1 patients showed a poorer prognosis, with respect to relapse-free survival period. The effect of DSS1 was examined in breast cancer cells in vitro. DSS1 high-expression reduces the susceptibility of MCF7 cells to DNA-damaging drugs, as observed in cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. DSS1 knockdown, however, increased the susceptibility to the DNA-damaging drugs camptothecin and etoposide and caused early apoptosis in p53 wild type MCF7 and p53-insufficient MDA-MB-231 cells. DSS1 knockdown suppresses the proliferation of drug-resistant MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, particularly effectively in combination with DNA-damaging agents.\n\nCONCLUSION: Breast cancers with high DSS1 expression have worse prognosis and shorter relapse-free survival times. DSS1 is necessary to rescue cells from DNA damage, but high DSS1 expression increases drug resistance. We suggest that DSS1 expression could be a useful marker for drug resistance in breast cancers, and DSS1 knockdown can induce tumor apoptosis when used in combination with DNA-damaging drugs."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "19921428", "_score": 394.6917, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Substitution [D019943:minor]", "Glutathione S-Transferase pi [D051549:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Glutathione Transferase [D005982:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Incidence [D015994:minor]", "Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary [D009386:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide [D020641:major]", "Proportional Hazards Models [D016016:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Ethnic Groups [D005006:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/statistics & numerical data [Q000706:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:major]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Genotype [D005838:minor]"], "text": "Pooled analysis indicates that the GSTT1 deletion, GSTM1 deletion, and GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphisms do not modify breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nThe GSTP1, GSTM1, and GSTT1 detoxification genes all have functional polymorphisms that are common in the general population.

The age of disease onset in the mutant allele carriers was highly variable and typically late onset (41-72 years for breast cancer and 48-73 years for ovarian cancer). Evaluation of family histories for the eight mutant allele carriers revealed that several individuals had significant cancer histories that included, in addition to breast and/or ovarian cancer, an increased incidence of colon, esophageal, pancreatic, stomach, and hematopoietic cancers. Interestingly, seven of the eight individuals were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Haplotype data for the mutant allele carriers using markers spanning the region of the BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13ql2-ql3 suggest that only two of the confirmed Jewish Ashkenazi individuals share a single common ancestry, indicating several independent origins for this mutation.

BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells were found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress, modeled by treatment with patho-physiologic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide exposure leads to oxidative DNA damage induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in BRCA-deficient cells causing them to accumulate in S-phase. In addition, after hydrogen peroxide treatment, BRCA deficient cells showed impaired Rad51 foci which are dependent on an intact BRCA1-BRCA2 pathway. These DSB resulted in an increase in chromatid-type aberrations, which are characteristic for BRCA1 and BRCA2-deficient cells. The most common result of oxidative DNA damage induced processing of S-phase DSB is an interstitial chromatid deletion, but insertions and exchanges were also seen in BRCA deficient cells. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for the repair of oxidative DNA damage repair intermediates that persist into S-phase and produce DSB.

We have previously reported that BRCA2 shows differential allelic expression and we hypothesize that the known variable penetrance of BRCA2 mutations might be associated with this mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: We combined haplotype analysis and differential allelic expression of BRCA2 in breast tissue to identify expression haplotypes and candidate cis-regulatory variants. These candidate variants underwent selection based on in silico predictions for regulatory potential and disruption of transcription factor binding, and were functionally analyzed in vitro and in vivo in normal and breast cancer cell lines. SNPs tagging the expression haplotypes were correlated with the total expression of several genes in breast tissue measured by Taqman and microarray technologies. The effect of the expression haplotypes on breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers was investigated in 2,754 carriers.\n\nRESULTS: We identified common haplotypes associated with differences in the levels of BRCA2 expression in human breast cells. We characterized three cis-regulatory SNPs located at the promoter and two intronic regulatory elements which affect the binding of the transcription factors C/EBP\u03b1, HMGA1, D-binding protein (DBP) and ZF5. We showed that the expression haplotypes also correlated with changes in the expression of other genes in normal breast. Furthermore, there was suggestive evidence that the minor allele of SNP rs4942440, which is associated with higher BRCA2 expression, is also associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer (per-allele hazard ratio (HR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72 to 1.00, P-trend = 0.048).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our work provides further insights into the role of cis-regulatory variation in the penetrance of disease-causing mutations.

Long-term OC use (>48 months) before a first full-term pregnancy was associated with an elevated risk of being classified as a mutBRCA carrier (odds ratio, 7.8; trend, P = 0.004).

In addition, 60 of the 142 low-risk women were randomly selected and age matched at 5-year intervals with the 30 mutation carriers. Mammographic features were extracted from the central regions of the breast images to characterize the mammographic density and heterogeneity of dense portions of the breast.

The applicability of these computer-extracted features and the output from linear discriminant analysis to differentiate between the carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and the low-risk women in the entire database and in an age-matched group were evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Quantitative analysis of mammograms demonstrated that carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations tended to have dense breast tissue, and their mammographic patterns tended to be low in contrast, with a coarse texture.

Histopathological features thus have utility for mutation prediction, including statistical modeling to assess pathogenicity of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants of uncertain clinical significance. We analyzed large pathology datasets accrued by the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) to reassess histopathological predictors of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, and provide robust likelihood ratio (LR) estimates for statistical modeling.\n\nMETHODS: Selection criteria for study/center inclusion were estrogen receptor (ER) status or grade data available for invasive breast cancer diagnosed younger than 70 years. The dataset included 4,477 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 2,565 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 47,565 BCAC breast cancer cases. Country-stratified estimates of the likelihood of mutation status by histopathological markers were derived using a Mantel-Haenszel approach.\n\nRESULTS: ER-positive phenotype negatively predicted BRCA1 mutation status, irrespective of grade (LRs from 0.08 to 0.90). ER-negative grade 3 histopathology was more predictive of positive BRCA1 mutation status in women 50 years or older (LR = 4.13 (3.70 to 4.62)) versus younger than 50 years (LR = 3.16 (2.96 to 3.37)). For BRCA2, ER-positive grade 3 phenotype modestly predicted positive mutation status irrespective of age (LR = 1.7-fold), whereas ER-negative grade 3 features modestly predicted positive mutation status at 50 years or older (LR = 1.54 (1.27 to 1.88)). Triple-negative tumor status was highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status for women younger than 50 years (LR = 3.73 (3.43 to 4.05)) and 50 years or older (LR = 4.41 (3.86 to 5.04)), and modestly predictive of positive BRCA2 mutation status in women 50 years or older (LR = 1.79 (1.42 to 2.24)).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results refine likelihood-ratio estimates for predicting BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status by using commonly measured histopathological features. Age at diagnosis is an important variable for most analyses, and grade is more informative than ER status for BRCA2 mutation carrier prediction. The estimates will improve BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant classification and inform patient mutation testing and clinical management."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15521105", "_score": 392.59006, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:major]", "Nucleic Acid Hybridization [D009693:minor]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4 [D002894:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Deletions on chromosome 4 in sporadic and BRCA mutated tumors and association with pathological variables.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Chromosomal aberrations in breast tumors from BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutation carriers are considerably more frequent than what is seen in sporadic breast tumors. According to Comparative Genomic Hybridisation analysis (CGH), deletions on chromosome 4 are one of the most frequent events in BRCA1-associated tumors, suggesting inactivation of specific tumor suppressor genes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 16 microsatellite markers covering chromosome 4 were used to map loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in tumors from BRCA1 (n=41) as well as in tumors from BRCA2 (n=66) mutation carriers and in tumors from unselected cases of breast cancer (n =68).\n\nRESULTS: The frequency of LOH in these groups ranged from 16-73% in BRCA1-associated tumors, 13-42% in BRCA2-associated tumors and 8-33% in unselected tumors. LOH was significantly more frequent in BRCA1-associated tumors as compared to BRCA2-associated tumors and unselected tumors, and particularly high (over 70%) at 4q35.2. Pathological variables that were found significantly associated (p< or =0.05) with LOH at specific markers were: high percentage of cells in S-phase, negative estrogen receptor status, young age at diagnosis and large tumors.

Hazard ratios (HR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for year of birth and study centre. The results for ever being parous and number of live-births were very similar for carriers of mutations in both genes. For all mutation carriers combined, the estimated HR associated with ever having had a live-birth was 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55-1.01, P = 0.06), and that associated with each live-birth was 0.87 (95%CI = 0.77-0.98, P = 0.02).

There was no evidence of an association between breast cancer risk and age at first birth for parous BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers (P-trend >or= 0.3).

Nevertheless, having a live-birth was associated with protection for BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR = 0.41, 95%CI = 0.18-0.94, P = 0.03), and a strong and consistent protective effect of age at first birth was observed for parous carriers of mutations in both genes (HR = 0.65, 95%CI = 0.52-0.83, P < 0.001).

Therefore, comprehensive identification of PALB2 germline mutations is potentially important for understanding their roles in tumorigenesis and for testing their potential utility as clinical targets. Most of the previous studies of PALB2 have focused on familial breast cancer cases with normal/wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCAx). We hypothesize that PALB2 genetic mutations also exist in individuals with BRCA mutations (BRCA+). To test this hypothesis, PALB2 germline mutations were screened in 107 exome data sets collected from familial breast cancer families who were either BRCA1+ or BRCAx. Two novel heterozygous mutations predicted to alter the function of PALB2 were identified (c.2014G>C, p.E672Q and c.2993G>A, p.G998E).

CGH revealed loss of chromosome 17 and chromosome 6q to be a frequent event in high-risk breast cancer families, while gain of 8q was most prevalent in low-risk families. The loss of chromosome 17 was consistent with previous LOH studies and so this region was investigated further. Disease was shown to be linked to chromosome 17 in those families exhibiting loss of the chromosome in both CGH and LOH analyses. An overlapping region of linkage was determined to lie between markers D17S1294 and D17S1293, fine mapping of the region delineated a region between markers D17S1880 and D17S1293. Ten genes were determined to lie within this 1.5 Mb region and families were screened for germline mutations in these genes.

Cells defective in BRCA2.FANCD1 are extremely sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) similarly to cells deficient in any of the Fanconi anemia (FA) complementation group proteins (FANC). These observations suggest that the FA pathway and the BRCA2 and Rad51 repair pathway may be linked, although a functional connection between these pathways in DNA damage signaling remains to be determined. Here, we systematically investigated the interaction between these pathways. We show that in response to DNA damage, BRCA2-dependent Rad51 nuclear focus formation was normal in the absence of FANCD2 and that FANCD2 nuclear focus formation and mono-ubiquitination appeared normal in BRCA2-deficient cells. We report that the absence of BRCA2 substantially reduced homologous recombination repair of DNA breaks, whereas the absence of FANCD2 had little effect. Furthermore, we established that depletion of BRCA2 or Rad51 had a greater effect on cell survival in response to MMC than depletion of FANCD2 and that depletion of BRCA2 in FANCD2 mutant cells further sensitized these cells to MMC.

Targeted management must consider their biology, pathology, and molecular genetics, all in concert with their respective carcinogenic pathways, as they may differ significantly from one breast cancer syndrome to the next. A striking example of management differences pertains to BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-positive breast cancers wherein those with BRCA1 mutations are frequently estrogen receptor (ER)-negative in contrast to BRCA2 mutations which are more frequently ER-positive; therein, significant differences exist with respect to anti-estrogen therapy which will be more amenable to BRCA2 versus BRCA1 mutation carriers manifesting breast cancer. In turn, tumors that are negative for ER, PR, and Her2-neu, often referred to as \"triple negative\" tumors, may also harbor a unique basal-like gene expression profile and are characterized by poor prognosis wherein endocrine and/or Her2-neu-targeted therapies are not effective treatment options. A further confounder pertains to the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer, which differs strikingly between BRCA1 mutation carriers, who show a 40-60% lifetime risk, and their BRCA2 counterparts, who carry a lifetime risk of approximately 12-15% for ovarian cancer.

The sequencing of the genes is expensive and since the information derived may have a profound effect on the individual and family members, it is important that testing is done only when the risk of carrying a mutation is thought to be high. Over the last decade, researchers have developed a number of statistical models for predicting risk for harboring mutations in these genes and the risk of subsequently developing breast and ovarian cancer. These models usually take into account the type of tumor and age at occurrence as well as family history. Data from pathological analysis show that although breast tumours are heterogeneous, there are histological characteristics that are seen more frequently in carriers of BRCA1 germ line mutations compared to BRCA2 and sporadic breast cancers. A number of authors have suggested that the addition of pathological data to risk algorithms may improve the predictive power of these models and provide a more accurate way of identifying individuals who may benefit from testing.

We also evaluated whether breast cancers in patients who were previously treated with radiation have a more aggressive phenotype, and whether the clinical course differed from a sporadic group of breast cancer patients.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: All females with Hodgkin's disease who were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer and for whom tissue blocks were available were included. Using a case-control design, case patients (previously treated with radiation therapy) were matched with sporadic control breast cancer patients for age, breast cancer stage, and date of breast cancer diagnosis. After microdissection of tumor and normal tissue from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, DNA was extracted and samples were examined for LOH at chromosomal segments encompassing BRCA1 and BRCA2. Breast cancer specimens were also evaluated in a blinded fashion for tumor grade and immunoreactivity to estrogen and progesterone receptors, p53, her2-neu, and topoisomerase II alpha. Comparisons were made between the case and control populations using chi2 analysis, and a paired Student's t test. Survival differences were evaluated using a log-rank test.\n\nRESULTS: From January 1960 to December 1983, 917 patients were diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Twelve patients were subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer and tissue blocks were available on 10 cases. No statistical difference was observed between the case and control populations for LOH at BRCA1 or BRCA2. In the Hodgkin's disease group, LOH was observed in 30% of tumors at BRCA1 and 10% of tumors at BRCA2 vs. 10% and 0% of tumors in the control group at BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively. Breast tumors from patients who received radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease displayed greater nuclear pleomorphism (p < 0.02), and an increase in topoisomerase II alpha expression (p < 0.05) vs. the control population. Five of 10 patients were pregnant at the time of their Hodgkin's treatment, and those patients had a shorter time interval to the development of breast cancer compared with the patients who were not pregnant (12.4 years compared with 18.6 years). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival; however, overall survival was inferior in the population previously treated with radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease (p = 0.01). 80% of patients with a previous Hodgkin's diagnosis died of breast cancer or treatment related effects vs. 30% in the control group.\n\nCONCLUSION: We were unable to find statistical evidence for LOH at BRCA1 and BRCA2 in breast cancers from patients previously irradiated for Hodgkin's disease. Breast cancer diagnosed after mantle irradiation may be more biologically aggressive based on the greater nuclear pleomorphism and increase in topoisomerase II alpha staining. This did not translate into a statistical difference in breast cancer disease-free survival; however, overall survival was significantly inferior in the Hodgkin's disease patients."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9192668", "_score": 390.37616, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mice [D051379:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Rad51 Recombinase [D051135:minor]", "Recombination, Genetic [D011995:minor]", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae [D012441:minor]", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins [D029701:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Animals [D000818:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Carrier Proteins [D002352:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Chromosome Mapping [D002874:minor]", "Cloning, Molecular [D003001:minor]", "DNA Repair [D004260:minor]", "DNA, Complementary [D018076:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/isolation & purification [Q000302:minor]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "RAB22 and RAB163/mouse BRCA2: proteins that specifically interact with the RAD51 protein.\n\n\nThe human RAD51 protein is a homologue of the bacteria RecA and yeast RAD51 proteins that are involved in homologous recombination and DNA repair.

Finally, a DNA deletion surrounded by microhomology signature found in human BRCA1/2-deficient cancers was not common in the genome of these mouse tumours.

The BRCA2-PALB2 interaction is crucial for certain key BRCA2 DNA damage response functions as well as its tumour suppression activity. Here we show, by screening for PALB2 mutations in Finland that a frameshift mutation, c.1592delT, is present at significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases compared with ancestry-matched population controls. The truncated PALB2 protein caused by this mutation retained little BRCA2-binding capacity and was deficient in homologous recombination and crosslink repair. Further screening of c.1592delT in unselected breast cancer individuals revealed a roughly fourfold enrichment of this mutation in patients compared with controls. Most of the mutation-positive unselected cases had a familial pattern of disease development. In addition, one multigenerational prostate cancer family that segregated the c.1592delT truncation allele was observed.

Two premature stop codons, Ser346ter and Tyr415ter, were identified in germ-line RAD52 alleles from 5% of early-onset breast cancer cases. Together, these two heterozygous mutations were also found in 8% of a healthy control population, indicating that they do not confer an increased risk for breast cancer. A rare germ-line missense mutation was identified in RAD54, whereas no sequence variants were found in RAD51. None of the three RAD genes demonstrated somatic mutations in breast cancer cell lines.

A portion of breast cancer patients also shows an elevated sensitivity to the induction of chromosome damage in cells exposed to ionizing radiation or chemical mutagens. Segregation analysis in families of patients with breast cancer indicated heritability of mutagen sensitivity. It has therefore been suggested that mutations in low-penetrance genes which are possibly involved in DNA repair predispose a substantial portion of breast cancer patients. Chromosomal mutagen sensitivity has been determined with the G2 chromosome aberration test and the G(0) micronucleus test (MNT). However, there seems to be no clear correlation between the results from the two tests, indicating that the inherited defect leading to enhanced G(0) sensitivity is different from that causing G2 sensitivity. Less than 5% of breast cancer patients have a familial form of the disease due to inherited mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2. Heterozygous mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in lymphocytes from women with familial breast cancer are also associated with mutagen sensitivity. Differentiation between mutation carriers and controls seems to be much better with the MNT than with the G2 assay. Mutagen sensitivity was detected with the MNT not only after irradiation but also after treatment with chemical mutagens including various cytostatics. The enhanced formation of micronuclei after exposure of lymphocytes to these substances suggests that different DNA repair pathways are affected by a BRCA1 mutation in accordance with the proposed central role of BRCA1 in maintaining genomic integrity. Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 seem to predispose cells to an increased risk of mutagenesis and transformation after exposure to radiation or cytostatics. This raises a question about potentially increased risks by mammography and cancer therapy in women carrying a mutation in one of the BRCA genes. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from breast cancer patients have been used to study the mechanisms and genetic changes associated with tumorigenesis. With respect to mutagen sensitivity, conflicting results have been reported. In particular enhanced induction of micronuclei does not seem to be a general feature of LCLs with a BRCA1 mutation in contrast to lymphocytes with the same mutation. Therefore, LCLs are of limited utility for studying the mechanisms underlying chromosomal mutagen sensitivity."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15024741", "_score": 389.8302, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Czech Republic [D018153:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]"], "text": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in women with familial or early-onset breast/ovarian cancer in the Czech Republic.\n\n\nGermline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

Doxorubicin (DOX) remains the cornerstone of chemotherapy in such individuals. However, it is often associated with cardiac failure, which once manifests carries a poor prognosis. Because BRCA2 regulates genome-wide stability and facilitates DNA damage repair, we hypothesized that loss of BRCA2 may increase susceptibility to DOX-induced cardiac failure. To this aim, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific BRCA2 knock-out (CM-BRCA2(-/-)) mice using the Cre-loxP technology and evaluated their basal and post-DOX treatment phenotypes. Although CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice exhibited no basal cardiac phenotype, DOX treatment resulted in markedly greater cardiac dysfunction and mortality in CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice compared with control mice. Apoptosis in left ventricular (LV) sections from CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice compared with that in corresponding sections from wild-type (WT) littermate controls was also significantly enhanced after DOX treatment. Microscopic examination of LV sections from DOX-treated CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice revealed a greater number of DNA double-stranded breaks and the absence of RAD51 focus formation, an essential marker of double-stranded break repair. The levels of p53 and the p53-related proapoptotic proteins p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and Bax were significantly increased in samples from CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice. This corresponded with increased Bax to Bcl-2 ratios and elevated cytochrome c release in the LV sections of DOX-treated CM-BRCA2(-/-) mice.

Hereditary PALB2 mutations are associated with an increased risk of breast and pancreatic cancers in heterozygotes. Breast cancer risk for PALB2 mutation carriers has recently been estimated at 33-58% depending on family history of breast cancer; pancreatic cancer risk in carriers of PALB2 mutations has not been precisely quantified, yet.\n\nMATERIALS AND RESULTS: Results of a study identifying PALB2 mutations in high-risk, BRCA1/2-negative, breast and/or ovarian cancer patients in the Czech Republic indicate that the frequency of hereditary PALB2 mutations in our population is quite high. Interestingly, almost 20% of all recognized mutations comprised large genomic rearrangements. The highest proportion of PALB2 mutations (comparable with the number of mutations reported for BRCA2) was found in a subgroup of hereditary breast cancer patients (5.5%). Frequency of mutations in an independent group of Czech unselected pancreatic cancer patients was approximately 1.3%.\n\nCONCLUSION: Considering the frequency of pathogenic, hereditary PALB2 mutations in our population, their phenotypic similarity to BRCA2, and expected risk of breast cancer associated with PALB2 mutations, its screen-ing (including large genomic rearrangements) should be encouraged in patients from hereditary breast cancer families. The follow-up of pathogenic PALB2 mutation carriers should be similar to that in BRCA2 mutation carriers, enabling early diagnosis, prevention, and possible targeted therapy. Preventive surgical interventions for the carriers could be considered in case of strong family cancer history and evident segregation of a pathogenic mutation with a tumor phenotype. Additional analysis of various cancer patient populations and further meta-analyses will be necessary for accurate assessment of PALB2 gene penetrance and its significance for the risk of pancreatic and other cancers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11170288", "_score": 388.94568, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Aged [D000368:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Prostatic Neoplasms [D011471:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Linkage [D008040:minor]", "Genetic Markers [D005819:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:minor]"], "text": "BRCA2 mutation in a family with hereditary prostate cancer.\n\n\nHereditary prostate cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, and so far four different susceptibility loci have been identified.

To rapidly detect all possible changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the breast cancer genes, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. All exons of both genes are covered by the DGGE scan, comprising 120 amplicons. We use a semiautomated approach, amplifying all individual amplicons with the same PCR program, after which the amplicons are pooled. DGGE is performed using three slightly different gel conditions. Validation was performed using DNA samples with known sequence variants in 107 of the 120 amplicons; all variants were detected. This DGGE mutation scanning, in combination with a PCR test for two Dutch founder deletions in BRCA1 was then applied in 431 families in which 52 deleterious changes and 70 unclassified variants were found. Fifteen unclassified variants were not reported before. The system was easily adopted by five other laboratories, where in another 3,593 families both exons 11 were analyzed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and the remaining exons by DGGE. In total, a deleterious change (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site mutation, or large deletion) was found in 661 families (16.4%), 462 in BRCA1 (11.5%), 197 in BRCA2 (4.9%), and in two index cases a deleterious change in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 was identified. Eleven deleterious changes in BRCA1 and 36 in BRCA2 had not been reported before.

Protein-truncating mutations in BRCA2 predispose women to early onset breast and ovarian cancers and account for 15-30% of familial breast cancer risk. In contrast, the human cancer risk due to missense mutations, intronic variants, and in-frame deletions and insertions in the BRCA2 gene, called unclassified variants, has not been determined. Here, we want to define if the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a good model to study the role of BRCA2 in DNA recombination and repair and to characterise the unclassified BRCA2 missense variants. Therefore, we expressed the wild-type BRCA2 in yeast and determined the effect of BRCA2 on yeast homologous recombination, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS)-induced Rad51 and Rad52 foci and MMS sensitivity. The expression of BRCA2 induces a high increase in both intra- and inter-recombination events and confers a higher MMS resistance as compared with the negative control. This may suggest that BRCA2 gets involved in DNA repair pathways in yeast. Moreover, the expression of BRCA2 did not affect the number of cells carrying Rad51 or Rad52 nuclear foci. Finally, we aimed to investigate if yeast could be reliable system to set up a functional assay to distinguish a mutated protein from a neutral polymorphism. Therefore, we have expressed two neutral (M1915T and A2951T) and one pathogenic variant (G2748D) in yeast and checked the effect on recombination. The neutral M1915T variant increased intra-chromosomal recombination by almost 2-fold and the other neutral A2975T variant increased intra-chromosomal recombination 2.5-fold as compared with the control. On the other end, the pathogenic variant G2748D did not increase intra- and inter-chromosomal recombination in yeast and, consequently, confers a phenotype very different from the wild-type BRCA2. Moreover, we have also evaluated whether the expression of the selected unclassified variants affects homologous recombination in yeast. Results indicated that the expression of the selected BRCA2 variants differentially affects yeast recombination suggesting that yeast could be a very promising genetic system to characterise BRCA2 missense variants."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20459916", "_score": 388.74265, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Prevalence [D015995:minor]", "African Continental Ancestry Group [D044383:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]", "European Continental Ancestry Group [D044465:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]"], "text": "Cancer prevalence in 129 breast-ovarian cancer families tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Women who carry germline mutations in the breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are at very high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.

Only in 30-70% of the families in which a hereditary component is suspected, a mutation in BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 is detected. Negative results may be due to: wrong selection of the proband; mutations in the regulatory portion of the genes; gene silencing due to epigenetic phenomena; or large genomic rearrangements that produce deletions of whole exons.

Here we show that acquired resistance to cisplatin can be mediated by secondary intragenic mutations in BRCA2 that restore the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. First, in a cisplatin-resistant BRCA2-mutated breast-cancer cell line, HCC1428, a secondary genetic change in BRCA2 rescued BRCA2 function. Second, cisplatin selection of a BRCA2-mutated pancreatic cancer cell line, Capan-1 (refs 3, 4), led to five different secondary mutations that restored the wild-type BRCA2 reading frame. All clones with secondary mutations were resistant both to cisplatin and to a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (AG14361). Finally, we evaluated recurrent cancers from patients whose primary BRCA2-mutated ovarian carcinomas were treated with cisplatin.

Moreover, among the genes recently associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer, four are Fanconi Anemia (FA) genes: FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1, FANCN/PALB2 and FANCO/RAD51C. FANCA is implicated in DNA repair and has been shown to interact directly with BRCA1. It has been proposed that the formation of FANCA/G (dependent upon the phosphorylation of FANCA) and FANCB/L sub-complexes altogether with FANCM, represent the initial step for DNA repair activation and subsequent formation of other sub-complexes leading to ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. As only approximately 25% of inherited breast cancers are attributable to BRCA1/2 mutations, FANCA therefore becomes an attractive candidate for breast cancer susceptibility. We thus analyzed FANCA gene in 97 high-risk French Canadian non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer individuals by direct sequencing as well as in 95 healthy control individuals from the same population.

In silico analyzes of relevant genomic variants have been performed in order to identify potential variations involved in the expression of these spliced transcripts.

To further understand the function of BRCA2, we used a yeast two-hybrid method and identified a novel BRCA2-interacting protein, BJ-HCC-20A, which is reported to be a potential cancer-testis antigen. We confirmed the interaction between endogenous BJ-HCC-20A and BRCA2 in mammalian cells, and showed that BJ-HCC-20A interacts with a portion of the highly conserved region of BRCA2 in various mammals, and M phase-specific phosphorylation of the binding region of BRCA2 modulates BJ-HCC-20A binding. Overexpression of BJ-HCC-20A increases cell growth, and downregulation of endogenous BJ-HCC-20A expression using small interfering RNA suppresses cell growth and leads to the induction of apoptosis. Importantly, the BJ-HCC-20A mRNA level is downregulated by adriamycin (ADR)-induced DNA damage and depletion of BJ-HCC-20A expression by small interfering RNA promotes the reduction of BRCA2 expression and enhances cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Additionally, the recovery of BJ-HCC-20A expression in ADR-induced DNA damage inhibits ADR-induced apoptosis. The data suggest that BJ-HCC-20A promotes cell growth and may regulate the induction of cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage in cooperation with BRCA2 in an M phase-dependent manner.

Somatic mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have not been found and the involvement of these genes in sporadic tumour development therefore remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: The study group consisted of 67 primary breast tumours with and without BRCA1 or BRCA2 abnormalities. Genomic alterations were profiled by high-resolution (~7 kbp) comparative genome hybridisation (CGH) microarrays. Tumour phenotypes were analysed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using selected biomarkers (ER, PR, HER-2, EGFR, CK5/6, CK8, CK18).\n\nRESULTS: Classification of genomic profiles through cluster analysis revealed four subgroups, three of which displayed high genomic instability indices (GII). Two of these GII-high subgroups were enriched with either BRCA1- or BRCA2-related tumours whereas the third was not BRCA-related. The BRCA1-related subgroup mostly displayed non-luminal phenotypes, of which basal-like were most prominent, whereas the other two genomic instability subgroups BRCA2- and GII-high-III (non-BRCA), were almost entirely of luminal phenotype. Analysis of genome architecture patterns revealed similarities between the BRCA1- and BRCA2 subgroups, with long deletions being prominent. This contrasts with the third instability subgroup, not BRCA-related, where small gains were more prominent.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BRCA1- and BRCA2-related tumours develop largely through distinct genetic pathways in terms of the regions altered while also displaying distinct phenotypes. Importantly, we show that the development of a subset of sporadic tumours is similar to that of either familial BRCA1- or BRCA2 tumours. Despite their differences, we observed clear similarities between the BRCA1- and BRCA2-related subgroups reflected in the type of genomic alterations acquired with deletions of long DNA segments being prominent. This suggests similarities in the mechanisms promoting genomic instability for BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated tumours, possibly relating to deficiency in DNA repair through homologous recombination. Indeed, this feature characterized both familial and sporadic tumours displaying BRCA1- or BRCA2-like spectrums of genomic alterations. The importance of these findings lies in the potential benefit from targeted therapy, through the use of agents leading to DNA double-strand breaks such as PARP inhibitors (olaparib) and cisplatin, for a much larger group of patients than the few BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutation carriers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "14732925", "_score": 387.59833, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:minor]", "Genes, Dominant [D005799:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]", "Hormones [D006728:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Protein Biosynthesis [D014176:major]", "Protein Isoforms [D020033:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Proteins [D011506:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Receptors, Estrogen [D011960:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]", "Receptors, Progesterone [D011980:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Trefoil Factor-1 [D000071163:minor]", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins [D025521:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Biomarkers [D015415:minor]", "Breast [D001940:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/cytology [Q000166:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Epithelial Cells [D004847:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]"], "text": "Germ-line mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 in the normal breast are associated with altered expression of estrogen-responsive proteins and the predominance of progesterone receptor A.\n\n\nThe breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are responsible for a large proportion of familial breast and ovarian cancer, yet little is known of how disruptions in the functions of the proteins these genes encode increased cancer risk preferentially in hormone-dependent tissue. There is no information on whether a germ-line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 causes disruptions in hormone-signaling pathways in the normal breast. In this study markers of hormone responsiveness were measured in prophylactically removed normal breast tissue (n = 31) in women bearing a germ-line pathogenic mutation in one of the BRCA genes. The estrogen receptor (ER) and proteins associated with ER action in hormone-sensitive tissues, namely, PS2 and the progesterone receptor (PR), were detected immunohistochemically. ER expression was not different in BRCA mutation carriers than in noncarriers, but there was a reduction in PS2 expression. PR expression was also reduced, and there was a striking lack of expression of the PRB isoform, which resulted in cases with PRA-only expression in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The alterations in PS2 and PR expression were similar in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, demonstrating that although these proteins are structurally and functionally distinct, there is overlap in their interaction with hormone-signaling pathways. This study provides evidence for altered cell function arising from loss of function of one BRCA allele in the normal breast, leading to PS2 loss, preferential PRB loss, and expression of PRA alone. In breast cancer development, PRA overexpression becomes evident in premalignant lesions and is associated with features of poor prognosis in invasive disease and altered cell function in vitro. The results of this study suggest that heterozygosity for a germ-line mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 results in development of PRA predominance. This is likely to lead to changes in progesterone signaling in hormone-dependent tissues, which may be a factor in the increased risk of cancer in these tissues in women with germ-line BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9245992", "_score": 387.5763, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 [D002882:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Linkage [D008040:major]", "Genetic Markers [D005819:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "Cancer risks in two large breast cancer families linked to BRCA2 on chromosome 13q12-13.\n\n\nThe penetrance of the BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13q12-13 has been estimated in two large, systematically ascertained, linked families, by use of a maximum-likelihood method to incorporate both cancer-incidence data and 13q marker typings in the families.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in 167 paraffin-embedded archival specimens. Normal prostate and 75% (120/160) of prostate-cancer tissue did not express BRCA2 protein. However, 25% (40/160) of cancer cases did express patchy staining; of these, 17% (2711 60) expressed positive nuclear staining in normal glandular tissue adjacent to tumour (either in addition to, or, independent of tumour). Allelic loss is the hallmark of a tumour-suppressor gene. Markers flanking (D13S267, D13S260) and within (D13S171) the BRCA2 gene indicated allelic loss in at least one locus in 23% (17/73) of tumours analyzed. There was no difference in the rates of allelic loss between sporadic and familial tumours, nor was there any association between immunohistochemical staining and allelic loss.

Therefore, it is of major importance to define the morphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of this group of tumors to improve genetic testing and also gain further insight into the biological characteristics of tumors.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the morphological characteristics of 37 tumors arising in women without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 20 tumors from BRCA1 mutation carriers, and 18 from BRCA2 mutation carriers, all of which were from index patients from breast cancer families. In addition, a tissue microarray was constructed with all tumoral samples to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of a wide panel of antibodies (11 antibodies) and the amplification of HER-2 and c-MYC genes by fluorescence in situ hybridization. An age-matched group with 50 sporadic breast cancers as controls for non-BRCA1/2 was also included.\n\nRESULTS: Non-BRCA1/2 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDCs) showed specific differences from BRCA1 tumors. They were of lower grade (1 and 2); more frequently estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, BCL2 positive, and p53 negative; had a low proliferation rate (Ki-67 immunostaining < 5%); and did not express P-cadherin. With respect to BRCA2 IDCs and control group, non-BRCA1/2 tumors were of lower grade and had a lower proliferation rate. No cases of HER-2 amplification and/or overexpression were observed except in the control group ( approximately 20%). In contrast, c-MYC amplification was present in 18.2, 62.5, and 12.5% of BRCA1, BRCA2, and non-BRCA1/2 IDCs, respectively, and 31% in the control group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study thus reveals distinct morphological and immunohistochemical features in non-BRCA1/2 and BRCA1 tumors, whereas BRCA2 tumors present characteristics intermediate between the two phenotypes.

It is not proven to what extent these strategies reduce risk of second cancers in such patients.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of tamoxifen therapy, bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy (PO), prophylactic contralateral mastectomy (PCM), and combinations of these strategies on life expectancy for women with unilateral breast cancer and a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation.\n\nDESIGN AND SETTING: Decision analysis using a Markov model. Probabilities for developing contralateral breast cancer and ovarian cancer, dying from these cancers, dying from primary breast cancer, and the reduction in cancer incidence and mortality due to prophylactic surgeries and/or tamoxifen were estimated from published studies.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical breast cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations facing decisions about secondary cancer prevention strategies.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Seven strategies, including 5 years of tamoxifen use, PO, PCM, and combinations of these strategies, compared with careful surveillance.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total and incremental life expectancy (LE) with each intervention strategy.\n\nRESULTS: Depending on the assumed penetrance of the BRCA mutation, compared with surveillance alone, 30-year-old early-stage breast cancer patients with BRCA mutations gain in LE 0.4 to 1.3 years from tamoxifen therapy, 0.2 to 1.8 years from PO, and 0.6 to 2.1 years from PCM. The magnitude of these gains is least for women with low-penetrance mutations (assumed contralateral breast cancer risk of 24% and ovarian cancer risk of 6%) and greatest for those with high-penetrance mutations (assumed contralateral breast cancer risk of 65% and ovarian cancer risk of 40%.) Older age and poorer prognosis from primary breast cancer further attenuate these gains.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Interventions to prevent second cancers, particularly PCM, may offer substantial LE gain for young women with BRCA-associated early-stage breast cancer.

Cytokinesis failure is often accompanied by the generation of cells with an unstable tetraploidy content, which predisposes the cells to develop aneuploidy and malignancies. A recent study by Venkitaraman's group demonstrates that BRCA2, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product, also functions in mediating normal cytokinesis. Similar to the subcellular localization of Aurora kinase, BRCA2 is present at the cleavage furrow and the midbody during late mitosis. Deficiency in BRCA2 function results in cytokinesis failure, which is associated with abnormal localization of myosin II, a key protein essential for the formation of the cleavage furrow.

We examined whether family history of breast cancer remains a predictive risk factor for this disease after carrier status for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations is taken into consideration.\n\nMETHODS: The data are from 4730 case subjects with breast cancer and 4688 control subjects enrolled in the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study. The probability of being a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene carrier was calculated for each woman. Among predicted noncarriers, logistic regression was used to assess the relationship (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) between case or control status and family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Estimates of age-specific breast cancer risk are presented by predicted carrier status.\n\nRESULTS: Among predicted noncarriers, case subjects were 2.06 times (95% CI = 1.69-2.50) and 1.24 times (95% CI = 1.17-1.32) more likely to report a first-degree or second-degree family history of breast cancer, respectively, than were control subjects. Case subjects were 1.99 times (95% CI = 1.63-2.44), 1.66 times (95% CI = 1.18-2.38), and 2.23 times (95% CI = 0.21-24.65) more likely to report an affected mother, sister, or both, respectively, than were control subjects. A family history of ovarian cancer was not statistically significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Noncarriers were predicted to have a lifetime risk of 9% of developing breast cancer compared with a 63% risk for carriers.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Among women with a moderate family history of breast cancer, i.e., predicted noncarriers of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations, family history remains a factor in predicting breast cancer risk. In families with breast and ovarian cancers, the aggregation of these two cancers appears to be explained by BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation-carrier probability."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10595253", "_score": 387.05048, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Europe [D005060:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]", "Genes, Dominant [D005799:minor]", "Genetic Counseling [D005817:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:major]", "Genotype [D005838:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Age Factors [D000367:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Models, Genetic [D008957:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary [D009386:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Oncogenes [D009857:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Predictive Value of Tests [D011237:minor]", "Probability [D011336:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Risk Assessment [D018570:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Sensitivity and Specificity [D012680:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:major]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Decision Making [D003657:major]", "Decision Support Techniques [D003661:major]"], "text": "Risk estimation as a decision-making tool for genetic analysis of the breast cancer susceptibility genes.

Screening was performed in affected women from 618 families for germ-line mutations in BRCA1 and in 176 families for BRCA2 mutations, using different methods including SSCP, CSGE, DGGE, FAMA and PTT analysis followed by direct sequencing. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were detected in 132 families and BRCA2 mutations in 16 families. The probability of being a carrier of a dominant breast cancer gene was calculated for the screened individual under the established genetic model for breast cancer susceptibility, first, with parameters for age-specific penetrances for breast cancer only [7] and, second, with age-specific penetrances for ovarian cancer in addition [20]. Our results indicate that the estimated probability of carrying a dominant breast cancer gene gives a direct measure of the likelihood of detecting mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For breast/ovarian cancer families, the genetic model according to Narod et al.

Current weight, body mass index, and adult weight gain appear to be predictors of postmenopausal breast cancer. These factors have been associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer. We asked whether there is an association between changes in body weight and the risk of breast cancer in women who carry a mutation in either breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1 or BRCA2.\n\nMETHODS: A matched case-control study was conducted in 1,073 pairs of women carrying a deleterious mutation in either BRCA1 (n = 797 pairs) or BRCA2 (n = 276 pairs). Women diagnosed with breast cancer were matched to control subjects by year of birth, mutation, country of residence, and history of ovarian cancer. Information about weight was derived from a questionnaire routinely administered to women who were carriers of a mutation in either gene. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association between weight gain or loss and the risk of breast cancer, stratified by age at diagnosis or menopausal status.\n\nRESULTS: A loss of at least 10 pounds in the period from age 18 to 30 years was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer between age 30 and 49 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.79); weight gain during the same interval did not influence the overall risk. Among the subgroup of BRCA1 mutation carriers who had at least two children, weight gain of more than 10 pounds between age 18 and 30 was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer diagnosed between age 30 and 40 (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.01-2.04). Change in body weight later in life (at age 30 to 40) did not influence the risk of either premenopausal or postmenopausal breast cancer.\n\nCONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that weight loss in early adult life (age 18 to 30) protects against early-onset BRCA-associated breast cancers.

The data set consisted of 1,484 women diagnosed with breast cancer under age 55 registered in the East Anglia Cancer registry between 1991-1996. Blood samples taken from the patients were analysed for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. The genetic models were constructed using information on breast and ovarian cancer history in first-degree relatives and on the mutation status of the index patients. We estimated the simultaneous effects of BRCA1, BRCA2, a third hypothetical gene BRCA3, and a polygenic effect. The models were assessed by likelihood comparisons and by comparison of the observed numbers of mutations and affected relatives with the predicted numbers. BRCA1 and BRCA2 could not explain all the familial clustering of breast cancer. The best-fitting single gene model for BRCA3 was a recessive model with a disease allele frequency 24% and penetrance 42% by age 70. However, a polygenic model gave a similarly good fit. The estimated population frequencies for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were similar under both recessive and polygenic models, 0.024 and 0.041%, respectively. A dominant model for BRCA3 gave a somewhat worse fit, although the difference was not significant. The mixed recessive model was identical to the recessive model and the mixed dominant very similar to the polygenic model. The BRCA3 genetic models were robust to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 penetrance assumptions. The overall fit of all models was improved when the known effects of parity on breast and ovarian cancer risks were included in the model-in this case a polygenic model fits best.

Women who are postmenopausal unaffected carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations will be selected by participating institutions and randomly assigned to receive either oral exemestane or oral placebo every day for 3 years in order to reduce the incidence of breast cancer. Genetic counseling and the detection of predisposing BRCA1/2 mutations are mandatory before accrual into the study. Signed informed consents for the performing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic analysis and for enrollment into the study are required. Eligible women will be followed thereafter in order to evaluate the efficacy of exemestane in reducing the incidental rate of breast cancer in unaffected postmenopausal carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "12569143", "_score": 386.40668, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Germany [D005858:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Lymphocytes [D008214:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Pancreatic Neoplasms [D010190:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Phenotype [D010641:minor]", "Registries [D012042:minor]", "Sequence Analysis, DNA [D017422:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]", "Europe [D005060:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Frameshift Mutation [D016368:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:major]"], "text": "BRCA2 germline mutations in familial pancreatic carcinoma.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Although as many as 10% of pancreatic cancer cases may have an inherited component, familial pancreatic cancer has not been linked to defects in any specific gene. Some studies have shown that families with germline mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2 have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers, as well as a modestly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. To study these relationships in more detail, we examined whether BRCA2 germline mutations are associated with familial pancreatic cancer.\n\nMETHODS: We identified 26 European families in which at least two first-degree relatives had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We sequenced genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from participating family members to identify germline mutations in BRCA2.\n\nRESULTS: Three (12%, exact 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2% to 30%) families carried germline frameshift mutations in the BRCA2 gene that are predicted to result in a truncated BRCA2 protein. Two additional families harbored mutations previously designated as unclassified variants of BRCA2. Thus, 19% (exact 95% CI = 7% to 39%) of the families in our study had either a frameshift mutation or an unclassified variant of BRCA2.

Founder mutations have been found in four breast-cancer-predisposing genes in French-Canadian breast cancer families. The frequencies of the mutant alleles have been measured neither in a large series of unselected breast cancer patients from Quebec, nor in healthy controls. These estimates are necessary to measure their contribution to the hereditary burden of breast cancer in Quebec and to help develop genetic screening policies which are appropriate for the province. We studied 564 French-Canadian women with early-onset invasive breast cancer who were treated at a single Montreal hospital. Patients had been diagnosed at age 50 or less, and were ascertained between 2004 and 2008. We screened all 564 patients for nine founder mutations: four in BRCA1, three in BRCA2 and one each in PALB2 and CHEK2. We also studied 6433 DNA samples from newborn infants from the Quebec City area to estimate the frequency of the nine variant alleles in the French-Canadian population. We identified a mutation in 36 of the 564 breast cancer cases (6.4%) and in 35 of 6443 controls (0.5%). In the breast cancer patients, the majority of mutations were in BRCA2 (54%). However, in the general population (newborn infants), the majority of mutations were in CHEK2 (54%). The odds ratio for breast cancer to age 50, given a BRCA1 mutation, was 10.1 (95% CI: 3.7-28) and given a BRCA2 mutation was 29.5 (95% CI: 12.9-67). The odds ratio for breast cancer to age 50, given a CHEK2 mutation, was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.4-9.1). One-half of the women with a mutation had a first- or second-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer. Thus, it can be concluded that a predisposing mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 or PALB2 is present in approximately 6% of French-Canadian women with early-onset breast cancer. It is reasonable to offer screening for founder mutations to all French-Canadian women with breast cancer before age 50.

Familial clustering of carcinoma is seen in about 20% of cases.\n\nMETHODS: We selectively review relevant articles published up to December 2010 that were retrieved by a search in PubMed, and we also discuss findings from the experience of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer.\n\nRESULTS: High risk is conferred by the highly penetrant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes as well as by other genes such as RAD51C. Genes for breast cancer that were originally designated as moderately penetrant display higher penetrance than previously thought in families with a hereditary predisposition. The role these genes play in DNA repair is thought to explain why tumors associated with them are sensitive to platin derivatives and PARP inhibitors. In carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and adnexectomy significantly lowers the incidence of breast and ovarian cancer. Moreover, prophylactic adnexectomy also lowers the breast-and-ovarian-cancer-specific mortality, as well as the overall mortality. If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.\n\nCONCLUSION: About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2). Women carrying a mutated gene have an 80% to 90% chance of developing breast cancer and a 20% to 50% chance of developing ovarian cancer.

However, it is also possible that part of the mutations disrupting BRCA1 and BRCA2 function still remains to be discovered. In response to double-strand DNA damage the co-operation between RAD51 and BRCA2 is of great importance, and the conserved BRC repeat motifs in BRCA2 are crucial for this interaction. In the current study, patients belonging to 126 breast and/or ovarian cancer families were screened for RAD51 and BRCA2 BRC repeat mutations in order to uncover aberrations that may contribute to hereditary cancer susceptibility.

We evaluate current knowledge of BRCA1 and BRCA2 functions to explain why mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead specifically to breast and ovarian cancer. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes contain unusually high densities of repetitive elements. These features of the BRCAs genomic regions contribute to chromosomal instability of these genes. We propose that somatic alterations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are common and driven by rearrangements between repetitive elements. Inherited and somatic mutations occur in BRCA1 and BRCA2; virtually all somatic mutations are the result of large genomic rearrangements. What are the consequences of such large somatic mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in women with or without inherited mutations? The breast and ovary are estrogen-responsive tissues. Beginning in puberty, the breast epithelium proliferates rapidly in response to fluctuating levels of estrogen. We present a genetic model outlining how BRCA-deficient cells may gain uncontrolled proliferation leading to tumor formation. Central to this model of BRCA-mediated tumorigenesis are estrogen-mediated proliferation of breast and ovarian epithelium and the distinctive genomic context of the BRCA genes."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "24676784", "_score": 385.52533, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]", "Neoadjuvant Therapy [D020360:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Risk Assessment [D018570:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Sequence Analysis, DNA [D017422:minor]/trends [Q000639:major]", "Early Detection of Cancer [D055088:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mastectomy [D008408:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]"], "text": "Opportunities and challenges of next-generation DNA sequencing for breast units.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: The aim of this review is to introduce the topic of next-generation DNA sequencing, a new technology that is being introduced into clinical practice, and to explain the potential impact for breast cancer surgeons and the wider breast cancer multidisciplinary team.\n\nMETHODS: The PubMed database was used to identify relevant studies relating to breast cancer genetics.

To explore the contribution that genetic factors make to these high rates, we have conducted a case-control study of 341 case subjects with breast cancer, 120 case subjects with ovarian cancer, and 200 female control subjects from two major cities of Pakistan (Karachi and Lahore). The prevalence of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations among case subjects with breast cancer was 6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1%-9.4%), and that among case subjects with ovarian cancer was 15.8% (95% CI 9.2%-22.4%). Mutations of the BRCA1 gene accounted for 84% of the mutations among case subjects with ovarian cancer and 65% of mutations among case subjects with breast cancer. The majority of detected mutations are unique to Pakistan. Five BRCA1 mutations (2080insA, 3889delAG, 4184del4, 4284delAG, and IVS14-1A-->G) and one BRCA2 mutation (3337C-->T) were found in multiple case subjects and represent candidate founder mutations.

Given these patients' high risk for contralateral breast cancer, bilateral mastectomy is increasingly considered a treatment option for newly diagnosed BRCA1/2 carriers. In the present study, we prospectively evaluated the impact on surgical decision-making of pretreatment genetic counseling and BRCA1/BRCA2 testing among breast cancer patients at high-risk for carrying a mutation.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants were 194 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who had not yet received definitive surgical treatment and who had at least a 10% prior probability of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation. Participants were offered free genetic counseling and rapid BRCA1/2 testing. Primary analyses focused on the impact of BRCA1/2 test result on subsequent breast cancer surgical treatment.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-eight percent of patients who were found to carry a BRCA1/2 mutation chose bilateral mastectomy as their definitive breast cancer surgery. In contrast, 24% of patients in whom no mutation was detected and 4% of test decliners opted for bilateral mastectomy. Additional predictors of bilateral mastectomy included patients' self-reports of physician recommendations for BRCA1/2 testing and bilateral mastectomy.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study highlights patient interest in and the technical feasibility of offering presurgery BRCA1/2 testing to high-risk patients. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that BRCA1/2 test results significantly affect patients' surgical decision-making.

The recent identification of breast cancer predisposing genes has provided new clinical insights in this field.\n\nDESIGN: English literature identified through Medline between 1976 and February 1999 was reviewed including search terms: breast cancer, survival, prognosis, family history, genetics, BRCA1, BRCA2, and related articles.\n\nRESULTS: Publications were divided into three categories. Family history-based studies: eighteen articles were reviewed. Four studies showed a statistically significant better survival in patients with a family history of breast cancer, and two studies demonstrated a significantly worse prognosis in this context. The remaining articles showed no significant difference. LINKAGE STUDIES: Two studies based on linkage to BRCA1 found that overall survival was better in linked families. A third one concluded to a worse outcome in BRCA2-linked tumors. MUTATION-BASED STUDIES: 10 studies looking at the association between germ-line mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Eight articles reported no significant difference in outcome, whereas two studies showed a worse outcome in patients with mutations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Conflicting data exist as to whether the prognosis of familial or hereditary breast cancer differs from that of sporadic cases. Some of the discrepancies may be explained by methodological differences or biases. However, no studies showed a survival advantage for BRCA1 mutation carriers. This seems to indicate that BRCA1-related breast cancer is not associated with a survival advantage, and that in fact, certain BRCA1 germline mutations confer a worse prognosis. However, to adequately answer this question, more efficient molecular tools to identify all the genetic changes responsible for breast cancer predisposition, and large cohort studies to evaluate their clinical consequences, are needed."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10359546", "_score": 385.0652, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Population Surveillance [D011159:minor]", "Prevalence [D015995:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "United Kingdom [D006113:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Case-Control Studies [D016022:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Incidence [D015994:minor]"], "text": "Prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations in patients with early-onset breast cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are found in most families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancer or with many cases of early-onset breast cancer.

Here we show that the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA2, which interacts directly with the essential recombination protein RAD51, contains a site (serine 3291; S3291) that is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. Phosphorylation of S3291 is low in S phase when recombination is active, but increases as cells progress towards mitosis. This modification blocks C-terminal interactions between BRCA2 and RAD51. However, DNA damage overcomes cell cycle regulation by decreasing S3291 phosphorylation and stimulating interactions with RAD51.

We specifically tested for 11 of the most commonly reported mutations in the two genes. Then, cases were assessed with the protein-truncation test (PTT) for exon 11 of BRCA1, with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for the remainder of BRCA1, and with PTT for exons 10 and 11 of BRCA2. No mutations were found in all 134 women with tumors of borderline histology. Among the 515 women with invasive cancers, we identified 60 mutations, 39 in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. The total mutation frequency among women with invasive cancers, 11.7% (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 9.2%-14.8%), is higher than previous estimates. Hereditary ovarian cancers diagnosed at age <50 years were mostly (83%) due to BRCA1, whereas the majority (60%) of those diagnosed at age >60 years were due to BRCA2. Mutations were found in 19% of women reporting first-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer and in 6.5% of women with no affected first-degree relatives. Risks of ovarian, breast, and stomach cancers and leukemias/lymphomas were increased nine-, five-, six- and threefold, respectively, among first-degree relatives of cases carrying BRCA1 mutations, compared with relatives of noncarriers, and risk of colorectal cancer was increased threefold for relatives of cases carrying BRCA2 mutations. For carriers of BRCA1 mutations, the estimated penetrance by age 80 years was 36% for ovarian cancer and 68% for breast cancer. In breast-cancer risk for first-degree relatives, there was a strong trend according to mutation location along the coding sequence of BRCA1, with little evidence of increased risk for mutations in the 5' fifth, but 8.8-fold increased risk for mutations in the 3' fifth (95%CI 3.6-22.0), corresponding to a carrier penetrance of essentially 100%. Ovarian, colorectal, stomach, pancreatic, and prostate cancer occurred among first-degree relatives of carriers of BRCA2 mutations only when mutations were in the ovarian cancer-cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11, whereas an excess of breast cancer was seen when mutations were outside the OCCR. For cancers of all sites combined, the estimated penetrance of BRCA2 mutations was greater for males than for females, 53% versus 38%. Past studies may have underestimated the contribution of BRCA2 to ovarian cancer, because mutations in this gene cause predominantly late-onset cancer, and previous work has focused more on early-onset disease. If confirmed in future studies, the trend in breast-cancer penetrance, according to mutation location along the BRCA1 coding sequence, may have significant impact on treatment decisions for carriers of BRCA1-mutations. As well, BRCA2 mutations may prove to be a greater cause of cancer in male carriers than previously has been thought."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "12491487", "_score": 383.9972, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["African Continental Ancestry Group [D044383:major]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Founder Effect [D018703:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Counseling [D005817:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]/statistics & numerical data [Q000706:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Breast cancer genetics in African Americans.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: An overview of the state of genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was presented at the Summit Meeting on Breast Cancer Among African American women.\n\nMETHODS: An exhaustive literature search was performed using PubMed and abstracts published from meetings of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Society of Human Genetics, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The Breast Cancer Information Core was also searched for information regarding sequence variants in which the ethnicity of the individual tested was known.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 26 distinct BRCA1 pathogenic mutations (protein-truncating, disease-associated missense, and splice variants) detected in Africans or African Americans, 15 (58%) have not been previously reported. In addition, 18 deleterious BRCA2 mutations have been identified and 10 (56%) of these are unique to the group. Only two pathogenic BRCA1 mutations (943ins10 and M1775R) have been detected in three or more unrelated families. However, seven additional BRCA1 or BRCA2 deleterious mutations have been reported in at least two unrelated families. Three of these recurrent BRCA1 mutations (943ins10, 1832del5, and 5296del4) have been characterized by haplotype studies and each likely arose from a common ancestor, including one ancestor that could be traced to the Ivory Coast in West Africa. Although only a few African-American families have been tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the probability of finding a mutation is invariably dependent on the age of onset and the number of breast and/or ovarian cancer cases in the family. The psychosocial implications of genetic testing for African Americans have not been well studied, so that high-risk African Americans may underestimate their risks of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Deleterious BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have been identified in African-American and African families. A number of unique mutations have been described, but recurrent mutations are widely dispersed and are not readily identifiable in the few families that have been tested.

Underscoring the importance of DNA repair in breast and ovarian tumorigenesis is the familial inherited cancer predisposition gene BRCA2. The role of BRCA2 in DNA double-strand break repair was first revealed based on its interaction with RAD51, a central player in homologous recombination. The RAD51 protein forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA, invades a DNA duplex, and initiates a search for homology. Once a homologous DNA sequence is found, the DNA is used as a template for the high-fidelity repair of the DNA break. Many of the biochemical features that allow BRCA2 to choreograph the activities of RAD51 have been elucidated and include: targeting RAD51 to single-stranded DNA while inhibiting binding to dsDNA, reducing the ATPase activity of RAD51, and facilitating the displacement of the single-strand DNA binding protein, Replication Protein A. These reinforcing activities of BRCA2 culminate in the correct positioning of RAD51 onto a processed DNA double-strand break and initiate its faithful repair by homologous recombination. In this review, I will address current biochemical data concerning the BRCA2 protein and highlight unanswered questions regarding BRCA2 function in homologous recombination and cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "16417627", "_score": 383.0533, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins [D051017:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:minor]", "Microsatellite Instability [D053842:major]", "Pancreatic Neoplasms [D010190:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Rad51 Recombinase [D051135:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Sequence Analysis, DNA [D017422:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]", "Colorectal Neoplasms [D015179:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "DNA Mismatch Repair [D053843:minor]", "DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Frameshift Mutation [D016368:major]", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms [D005770:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Does tumorigenesis select for or against mutations of the DNA repair-associated genes BRCA2 and MRE11?: considerations from somatic mutations in microsatellite unstable (MSI) gastrointestinal cancers.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: The BRCA2 and MRE11 proteins participate in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks by homologous recombination. Germline BRCA2 mutations predispose to ovarian, breast and pancreatic cancer, while a germline MRE11 mutation is associated with an ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder. Somatic mutations of BRCA2 are rare in typical sporadic cancers. In tumors having microsatellite instability (MSI), somatic truncating mutations in a poly [A] tract of BRCA2 are reported on occasion.\n\nRESULTS: We analyzed gastrointestinal MSI cancers by whole gene BRCA2 sequencing, finding heterozygous truncating mutations in seven (47%) of 15 patients. There was no cellular functional defect in RAD51 focus-formation in three heterozygously mutated lines studied, although other potential functions of the BRCA2 protein could still be affected. A prior report of mutations in primary MSI tumors affecting the IVS5-(5-15) poly [T] tract of the MRE11 gene was confirmed and extended by analysis of the genomic sequence and protein expression in MSI cancer cell lines. Statistical analysis of the published MRE11 mutation rate in MSI tumors did not provide evidence for a selective pressure favoring biallelic mutations at this repeat.\n\nCONCLUSION: Perhaps conflicting with common suspicions, the data are not compatible with selective pressures during tumorigenesis promoting the functional loss of BRCA2 and MRE11 in MSI tumors.

We have further developed this model to take into account relevant features of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated tumors, such as the characteristic histopathology and immunochemical profiles associated with pathogenic mutations in BRCA1, and the fact that approximately 80% of tumors from BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers undergo inactivation of the wild-type allele by loss of heterozygosity.

These results establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and prohibiting RAD51 nucleation onto dsDNA.

So far, little is known about the safety of exogenous hormonal use in mutation carriers. In this study, we examined the association between oral contraceptive use and risk of breast cancer among BRCA1/2 carriers. PATIENTS AND METHODS In the International BRCA1/2 Carrier Cohort study (IBCCS), a retrospective cohort of 1,593 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers was analyzed with a weighted Cox regression analysis. Results We found an increased risk of breast cancer for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who ever used oral contraceptives (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.87). HRs did not vary according to time since stopping use, age at start, or calendar year at start. However, a longer duration of use, especially before first full-term pregnancy, was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (4 or more years of use before first full-term pregnancy: HR = 1.49 [95% CI, 1.05 to 2.11] for BRCA1 carriers and HR = 2.58 [95% CI, 1.21 to 5.49] for BRCA2 carriers). CONCLUSION No evidence was found among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers that current use of oral contraceptives is associated with risk of breast cancer more strongly than is past use, as is found in the general population. However, duration of use, especially before first full-term pregnancy, may be associated with an increasing risk of breast cancer among both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "17686574", "_score": 383.00397, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Alleles [D000483:minor]", "E2F1 Transcription Factor [D050687:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]", "Nucleotides [D009711:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]", "Polyploidy [D011123:major]", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases [D017346:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Retinoblastoma Protein [D016160:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins [D051017:minor]", "Aurora Kinase B [D064107:minor]", "Aurora Kinases [D064127:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Cell Cycle [D002453:minor]", "Cell Nucleus [D002467:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21 [D050759:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]"], "text": "Suppression of polyploidy by the BRCA2 protein.\n\n\nMounting evidence implicates BRCA2 not only in maintenance of genome integrity but also in cell-cycle checkpoints.

In addition, the role of the breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS is unclear.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To better define the role of: (1) a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and (2) the cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, in the development of BCIS.\n\nMETHODS: The data are 875 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 123 lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) cases diagnosed among residents of the state of Connecticut from September 15, 1994 to March 14, 1998 and between the age of 20 and 79 years. Controls (n = 999) are female Connecticut residents collected via random-digit-dial and frequency matched to the cases by 5-year age intervals. Telephone interviews were used to collect information on risk factors and cancer screening history. Logistic regression was used to provide maximum likelihood estimates of the odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The probability of being a BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 gene carrier was calculated for each case and control, using family history of breast and ovarian cancer, age/age at diagnosis for relatives, prevalence and penetrance data for BRCA1/BRCA2, and self-report of Jewish heritage.\n\nRESULTS: Cases with DCIS or LCIS were significantly more likely to report a first degree family history of breast cancer (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.3, 2.1 and 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.9, respectively) than were controls. In addition, DCIS cases were 2.4 (95% Cl: 0.8, 7.2) times more likely than controls to report both an affected mother and sister. An inverse association was suggested between age at onset and DCIS risk with cases aged 49 years or younger at 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) times the risk of controls (95% CI) versus 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 2.0) for cases older than 49 years. An elevated risk of DCIS was associated with a family history of ovarian cancer but did not reach statistical significance (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.7, 2.5). Approximately 3.7% and 1.9% of DCIS cases were predicted to carry a mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A family history of breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of DCIS and LCIS, particularly among women with multiple relatives affected at early ages.

A significant proportion occurs in families with a history of breast cancer and in particular those carrying BRCA2 mutations. Here we describe clinicopathological features and genomic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status in a large cohort of familial MBCs.\n\nMETHODS: Cases (n=60) included 3 BRCA1 and 25 BRCA2 mutation carries, and 32 non-BRCA1/2 (BRCAX) carriers with strong family histories of breast cancer. The cohort was examined with respect to mutation status, clinicopathological parameters including TNM staging, grade, histological subtype and intrinsic phenotype.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to the general population, MBC incidence was higher in all subgroups. In contrast to female breast cancer (FBC) there was greater representation of BRCA2 tumours (41.7% vs 8.3%, p=0.0008) and underrepresentation of BRCA1 tumours (5.0% vs 14.4%, p=0.0001). There was no correlation between mutation status and age of onset, disease specific survival (DSS) or other clincopathological factors. Comparison with sporadic MBC studies showed similar clinicopathological features. Prognostic variables affecting DSS included primary tumour size (p=0.003, HR:4.26 95%CI 1.63-11.11), age (p=0.002, HR:4.09 95%CI 1.65-10.12), lymphovascular (p=0.019, HR:3.25 95%CI 1.21-8.74) and perineural invasion (p=0.027, HR:2.82 95%CI 1.13-7.06). Unlike familial FBC, the histological subtypes seen in familial MBC were more similar to those seen in sporadic MBC with 46 (76.7%) pure invasive ductal carcinoma of no special type (IDC-NST), 2 (3.3%) invasive lobular carcinomas and 4 (6.7%) invasive papillary carcinoma. A further 8 (13.3%) IDC-NST had foci of micropapillary differentiation, with a strong trend for co-occurrence in BRCA2 carriers (p=0.058). Most tumours were of the luminal phenotype (89.7%), with infrequent HER2 (8.6%) and basal (1.7%) phenotype tumours seen.\n\nCONCLUSION: MBC in BRCA1/2 carriers and BRCAX families is different to females. Unlike FBC, a clear BRCA1 phenotype is not seen but a possible BRCA2 phenotype of micropapillary histological subtype is suggested. Comparison with sporadic MBCs shows this to be a high-risk population making further recruitment and investigation of this cohort of value in further understanding these uncommon tumours."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "19139771", "_score": 382.7588, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Heterozygote Detection [D006580:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Iran [D007492:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]"], "text": "Penetrance of BRCA1/BRCA2 specific gene mutations in Iranian women with breast cancer.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the penetrance of breast cancer genes 1 and 2 BRCA1/BRCA2 specific gene mutations in Iranian women with breast cancer.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted this study in the Department of Biostatistics, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran between January and May 2008.

In the absence of BRCA2, BubR1 acetylation is abolished, and the level of BubR1 decreases during mitosis. Similarly, Brca2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited weak SAC activity. Transgenic mice that were engineered to have interruptions in the BRCA2-BubR1 association exhibited marked decrease of BubR1 acetylation, weakened SAC activity, and aneuploidy. These transgenic mice developed spontaneous tumors at 40% penetrance.

In this report we present the results of mutational analysis of the BRCA2 coding sequences in 105 high-risk individuals affected with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer and previously found to be negative for mutations of the BRCA1 coding sequence in our laboratory. These individuals have a positive family history with three or more cases of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer at any age from the same side of the family tree. In order to perform a high throughput and reliable mutational analysis of the BRCA genes, we have adapted the conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis mutation-scanning assay to a fluorescent platform. The advantages are speed, reproducibility and enhanced resolving power of the scanning method. Four unique mutations, including one missense and three frameshift mutations, were identified in the pool of 60 non-Jewish patients (7%). Two cases of the 6174delT mutation were identified in the 45 Ashkenazi Jewish individuals studied (5%).

To determine whether such genomic alterations lead to Fhit inactivation, we have assessed the level of Fhit expression by immunohistochemical detection in sporadic tumors and cancers occurring in BRCA2 999del5 carriers. To determine whether Fhit inactivation may have prognostic significance, we have also assessed expression of breast cancer markers and clinical features in sporadic tumors relative to Fhit expression.

Thus, genetic alteration at the fragile site within the FHIT gene leads to loss of Fhit protein in a significant fraction of sporadic breast cancers and a much larger fraction of familial breast cancers with an inherited BRCA2 mutation, consistent with the idea that loss of BRCA2 function affects stability of the FHIT/FRA3B locus."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11060334", "_score": 381.9253, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Anticarcinogenic Agents [D016588:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Prostatic Neoplasms [D011471:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic [D016032:minor]", "Tamoxifen [D013629:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/prevention & control [Q000517:major]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]", "Heterozygote [D006579:minor]"], "text": "Chemoprevention options for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\n\nBRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer predisposition gene mutation carriers are at markedly increased risk of breast and other cancers.

A central feature of the in vivo pattern of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression is that each of these putative tumor suppressor genes is expressed at maximal levels in rapidly proliferating cells. This feature is consistent with in vitro observations that BRCA1 and BRCA2 are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This feature is also well illustrated during mammary gland development wherein the expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is induced in rapidly proliferating cellular compartments undergoing differentiation, such as terminal end buds during puberty and developing alveoli during pregnancy.

Interpretation of test results and risk assessment is therefore complex. It has been proposed that families with mutations in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11 (nucleotides 3035-6629) express a higher ratio of ovarian to breast cancer, than families with mutations elsewhere in the BRCA2 gene. In this study we have investigated the presence of 7 types of cancer (ovary, male breast, pancreas, prostate, colon, stomach and melanoma) in first- and second-degree relatives of mutation-positive individuals in 440 families with a BRCA2 mutation. We reviewed histories of cancer in relatives among families with mutations distributed throughout the gene. Families with ovarian cancer were more likely to harbour mutations in the OCCR (nucleotides 3035-6629) than elsewhere in the gene (OR = 2.21; P = 0.0002). We also compared cancer risks according to ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jewish families with the 6174delT founder mutation were more likely to have a family member with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.58; P = 0.002) and less likely to have a family member with prostate cancer (OR = 0.62; P = 0.04) than were non-Jewish families. In contrast, a reduced presence of ovarian cancer was found in families of French-Canadian ancestry, compared to other ancestries (OR = 0.37; P = 0.0026). A high risk of male breast cancer was observed with the 6503delTT mutation (OR = 15.7; P = 0.023). Families of Polish ancestry had a reduced frequency of pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.0; P = 0.03) compared to families of other ethnic origins.

In addition, the observation of nonrandom loss of the wild-type chromosome in a breast/ovarian cancer family which shows linkage to BRCA2 suggests it may act as a tumor suppressor gene. To determine the extent of somatic alteration involving BRCA2 in sporadic ovarian cancer, 50 tumors were analyzed for mutations throughout the entire BRCA2 coding region. Mutations predicted to result in truncation of the BRCA2 protein were detected in four tumors. Analysis of germline DNA revealed two of these alterations to be of somatic origin. In addition, all four tumors exhibited loss of the second BRCA2 allele as predicted by Knudson's hypothesis for a tumor suppressor gene.

This study assessed the long-term risks of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer in a cohort of young women who underwent breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy.\n\nMETHODS: Between 1975 and 1998, 290 women with breast cancer diagnosed at age 42 years or younger underwent lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy at our hospital. We recruited 127 of these women for complete sequencing of BRCA1 and BRCA2. Demographic, clinical, pathological, and outcome data were recorded. The primary endpoints were rates of ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer, in relation to germline BRCA1/2 status.\n\nFINDINGS: 105 women were classified as having sporadic disease (94 with wild-type or known polymorphisms and 11 with variants of unclear significance) and 22 as having genetic predisposition (deleterious mutations in BRCA1 [15] or BRCA2 [seven]). At 12 years of follow-up, the genetic group had significantly higher rates of ipsilateral (49% vs 21%, p=0.007) and contralateral events (42% vs 9%, p=0.001) than the sporadic group. The majority of events were classified as second primary tumours. No patient in the genetic group had undergone oophorectomy or was taking prophylactic agents such as tamoxifen.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Patients with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a high risk of developing late ipsilateral and contralateral second primary tumours. With breast-conserving therapy, chemoprophylaxis or other interventions to reduce the rate of second cancers may be valuable. Alternatively, bilateral mastectomy may be considered, to minimise the risk of second tumours in the breasts."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "18679827", "_score": 380.64383, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Melanoma [D008545:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]", "Skin Neoplasms [D012878:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "European Continental Ancestry Group [D044465:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Founder Effect [D018703:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Jews [D007585:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]"], "text": "Absence of founder BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in cutaneous malignant melanoma patients of Ashkenazi origin.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: Several epidemiologic studies have provided suggestive evidence of a link between coetaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) and breast cancer.

We included premenopausal women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 26 and 47 years of age. We determined the age of onset of amenorrhea after breast cancer for women who were and were not treated with chemotherapy, alone or with tamoxifen. We considered chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea to have occurred when the patient experienced \u2265 2 years of amenorrhea, commencing within 2 years of initiating chemotherapy, with no resumption of menses.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 1,426 women who received chemotherapy, 35% experienced long-term amenorrhea. Of the 528 women who did not receive chemotherapy, 5.3% developed long-term amenorrhea. The probabilities of chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea were 7.2% for women diagnosed before age 30 years, 33% for women age 31 to 44 years, and 79% for women diagnosed after age 45 years (P trend < .001).

Allele frequencies of these polymorphisms were investigated to determine if they modify risk in BRCA mutation carriers in breast cancer cases drawn from French Canadian cancer families, a population shown to exhibit strong founder effects.\n\nMETHODS: The frequencies of the TP53 alleles, genotypes and haplotypes of 157 index breast cancer cases comprised of 42 BRCA1 mutation carriers, 57 BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 58 BRCA mutation-negative cases, where each case was drawn from independently ascertained families were compared. The effect of TP53 variants on the age of diagnosis was also investigated for these groups. The TP53 polymorphisms were also investigated in 112 women of French Canadian descent with no personal history of cancer.\n\nRESULTS: The BRCA mutation-positive groups had the highest frequency of homozygous carriers of the 72Pro allele compared with mutation-negative group. The TP53 polymorphisms exhibited linkage disequilibrium (p < 0.001), where the 72Arg and Ins16minus alleles occurred in strong disequilibrium. The highest frequency of carriers of Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype occurred in the BRCA mutation-negative groups. The BRCA1 mutation carriers homozygous for the 72Pro allele had the youngest ages of diagnosis of breast cancer. However none of these observations were statistically significant. In contrast, the BRCA2 mutation carriers homozygous for the 72Pro allele had a significantly older age of diagnosis of breast cancer (p = 0.018). Moreover, in this group, the mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer in carriers of the Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype was significantly younger than that of the individuals who did not this carry this haplotype (p = 0.009).\n\nCONCLUSION: We observed no significant association of breast cancer risk with TP53 genetic variants based on BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status. Although the small sample size did not permit analysis of all possible haplotypes, we observed that BRCA2 mutation carriers harboring the Ins16minus-72Arg haplotype had a significantly younger mean age of diagnosis of breast cancer.

Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the CLS peptides from BRCA2 (GFP-CLS) localizes to centrosomes and prevents endogenous BRCA2 from localizing to centrosomes.

In a comprehensive study, the entire coding sequences of the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 were analyzed in 989 unrelated patients from German breast/ovarian cancer families. A total of 77 BRCA1 and 63 BRCA2 distinct deleterious mutations were found in 302 patients. More than (1/3) of these mutations are novel and might be specific for the German population. Eighteen common mutations were found in 68% of cases in BRCA1 and 13 recurrent mutations in 44% of cases in BRCA2, facilitating prescreening approaches. Haplotype analysis indicate that 14 out of 20 recurrent mutations are likely originating from a common founder. An additional 50 different rare sequence variants with unknown relevance for tumorigenesis were found in 72 families. Correlation of BRCA1/BRCA2 detection rates with family history identified families with both breast and ovarian cancer to be at highest risk for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (43% and 10%, respectively), followed by families with at least 2 premenopausal cases of breast cancer (24% BRCA1 and 13% BRCA2 mutations). These data provide strong evidence for further predisposing genes in the German population. In breast cancer families with 2 or 3 affected females but only a single or no premenopausal case, mutations were detected with low frequencies (about 10% or less for both genes).

For stage 2 screening, we applied the conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) method by adapting this technique to automated heteroduplex analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using fragment scanning on an ABI 377 sequencing device.

We analyzed the age of breast cancer detection of 1,304 first- and second-degree relatives of 314 BRCA1, 164 BRCA2 and 244 high-risk participants of the Dutch MRI-SCreening study. The within- and between-family variance in the relative's age at diagnosis was analyzed with a random effect linear regression model. We compared the starting age of screening based on risk-group (25 years for BRCA1, 30 years for BRCA2 and 35 years for familial risk), on family history, and on the model, which combines both. The findings were validated in 63 families from the UK-MARIBS study. Mean age at diagnosis in the relatives varied between families; 95% range of mean family ages was 35-55 in BRCA1-, 41-57 in BRCA2- and 44-60 in high-risk families. In all, 14% of the variance in age at diagnosis, in BRCA1 even 23%, was explained by family history, 7% by risk group.

Uncertainty regarding the role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing in high-risk women from diverse ancestral backgrounds exists because of variability in prevalence estimates of deleterious (disease-associated) mutations in non-white populations.

The majority of cases are sporadic but around 15% show some type of familial aggregation and about 5% exhibit a clear hereditary pattern. Common and rare low- moderate-penetrance genes, and high-penetrance genes are thought to explain the genetic susceptibility to the disease. Only around 20% of the inherited risk to breast cancer is explained by germline mutations in the known high-penetrance susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in genes such as TP53 and PTEN have also been linked with high risk for breast cancer within specific cancer syndromes and rare germline variants in genes such as CHEK2 and ATM have been found to confer modest risk to breast cancer. However, we can say that less than 30% of familial risk of breast cancer is due to known genes. Identification in 2002 of the Fanconi anaemia (FA) gene FANCD1 as BRCA2 and recent studies indicating that heterozygous mutations in FANCN/PALB2 and FANCJ/ BRIP1 predispose to breast cancer have emphasised an important connection between the FA and BRCA pathway.

Multivariate analysis has revealed that the M/V784 polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor, being independent of the other conventional prognostic factors such as lymph node status and estrogen receptor status.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that the M/V784 polymorphism, but not the N/H372 polymorphism, would be useful in the selection of women at high risk for developing breast cancer and would also serve as a clinically useful prognostic factor in breast cancer patients."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "26852015", "_score": 379.22906, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]", "Germ-Line Mutation [D018095:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Haplotypes [D006239:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group [D044466:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "China [D002681:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Founder Effect [D018703:minor]"], "text": "Novel germline mutations and unclassified variants of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Chinese women with familial breast/ovarian cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes greatly increase a woman's risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer. The prevalence and distribution of such mutations differ across races/ethnicities. Several studies have investigated Chinese women with high-risk breast cancer, but the full spectrum of the mutations in these two genes remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: In this study, 133 unrelated Chinese women with familial breast/ovarian cancer living in Zhejiang, eastern China, were enrolled between the years 2008 and 2014. The complete coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were screened by PCR-sequencing assay. Haplotype analysis was performed to confirm BRCA1 and BRCA2 founder mutations. In silico predictions were performed to identify the non-synonymous amino acid changes that were likely to disrupt the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 23 deleterious mutations were detected in the two genes in 31 familial breast/ovarian cancer patients with a total mutation frequency of 23.3% (31/133). The highest frequency of 50.0% (8/16) was found in breast cancer patients with a history of ovarian cancer. The frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were 13.5 % (18/133) and 9.8% (13/133), respectively. We identified five novel deleterious mutations (c.3295delC, c.3780_3781delAG, c.4063_4066delAATC, c.5161 > T and c.5173insA) in BRCA1 and seven (c.1-40delGA, c.4487delC, c.469_473delAAGTC, c.5495delC, c.6141T > A, c.6359C > G and c.7588C > T) in BRCA2, which accounted for 52.2% (12/23) of the total mutations. Six recurrent mutations were found, including four (c.3780_3781delAG, c.5154G > A, c.5468-1del8 and c.5470_5477del8) in BRCA1 and two (c.3109C > T and c.5682C > G) in BRCA2. Two recurrent BRCA1 mutations (c.5154G > A and c.5468-1del8) were identified as putative founder mutations. We also found 11 unclassified variants, and nine of these are novel. The possibility was that each of the non-synonymous amino acid changes would disrupt the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 varied according to the different algorithms used.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations accounted for a considerable proportion of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer patients from eastern China and the spectrum of the mutations of these two genes exhibited some unique features. The two BRCA1 putative founder mutations may provide a cost-effective option to screen Chinese population, while founder effects of the two mutations should be investigated in a lager sample size of patients."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9242436", "_score": 379.2285, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]", "Polymorphism, Genetic [D011110:minor]", "Rats [D051381:minor]", "Sequence Alignment [D016415:minor]", "Tissue Distribution [D014018:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Animals [D000818:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Blotting, Northern [D015152:minor]", "Consensus Sequence [D016384:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mice [D051379:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]"], "text": "Characterization of the rat and mouse homologues of the BRCA2 breast cancer susceptibility gene.\n\n\nInherited BRCA2 mutations confer profound susceptibility to human breast and ovarian cancer.

Functional analyses of candidate variants were performed by lymphocyte RT-PCR and/or hybrid minigene assays. Forty-one BIC variants of exons 19, 20, 23 and 24 were bioinformatically selected and generated by PCR-mutagenesis of the wild type minigenes.\n\nRESULTS: Lymphocyte RT-PCR of c.8488-1G > A showed intron 19 retention and a 12-nucleotide deletion in exon 20, whereas c.9026_9030del did not show any splicing anomaly. Minigene analysis of c.8488-1G > A displayed the aforementioned aberrant isoforms but also exon 20 skipping. We further evaluated the splicing outcomes of 41 variants of four BRCA2 exons by minigene analysis. Eighteen variants presented splicing aberrations. Most variants (78.9%) disrupted the natural splice sites, whereas four altered putative enhancers/silencers and had a weak effect. Fluorescent RT-PCR of minigenes accurately detected 14 RNA isoforms generated by cryptic site usage, exon skipping and intron retention events. Fourteen variants showed total splicing disruptions and were predicted to truncate or eliminate essential domains of BRCA2.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A relevant proportion of BRCA2 variants are correlated with splicing disruptions, indicating that RNA analysis is a valuable tool to assess the pathogenicity of a particular DNA change.

With Genistein, we observed a 60% increase of BRCA2 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a, which are, respectively, estrogen receptors alpha-/beta+ and alpha-/beta-, and no variation in MCF7, which is ERalpha+/beta+. Dairzein had no effect on BRCA2 mRNA expression. The level of BRCA2 protein with both food components also remained unchanged in all three cell lines. This suggests regulation of BRCA2 between the mRNA and protein levels.

With actinomycin D, genistein had a positive effect on the transcriptional level of BRCA2 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MCF10a.

The risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer is increased for men carrying a pathogenic germline mutation in BRCA2. An earlier study by the Kathleen Cuningham Consortium for Research into Familial Breast Cancer showed that BRCA2 mutation carriers displayed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) within their prostate cancer tissue in the majority of cases, thus implying that the prostate cancer in these men occurred as a result of LOH for BRCA2.

The study found that there was no LOH for BRCA2 in HGPIN. From this small cohort of BRCA2-positive men, we suggest HGPIN is not necessarily a precursor to their prostate cancer development.

A close correlation was observed between FOXM1 and the expression of its proposed downstream targets that are involved in DNA repair; breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BRCA2) and X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) were expressed at higher levels in the resistant cell lines compared with the sensitive MCF-7 cells. Moreover, cisplatin treatment induced DNA damage repair in MCF-7-CIS(R) and not in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the expression of a constitutively active FOXM1 (DeltaN-FOXM1) in MCF-7 cells alone was sufficient to confer cisplatin resistance. Crucially, the impairment of DNA damage repair pathways through the small interfering RNA knockdown inhibition of either FOXM1 or BRCA2/XRCC1 showed that only the silencing of FOXM1 could significantly reduce the rate of proliferation in response to cisplatin treatment in the resistant cells. This suggests that the targeting of FOXM1 is a viable strategy in circumventing acquired cisplatin resistance. Consistently, the FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton also showed efficacy in causing cell death and proliferative arrest in the cisplatin-resistant cells through the downregulation of FOXM1 expression.

We estimate the impact of different risk-reducing options at various ages on life expectancy.\n\nMETHODS: We apply our previously developed Monte Carlo simulation model of screening and prophylactic surgery in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Here, we present the mathematical formulation to compute age-specific breast cancer incidence in the absence of prophylactic oophorectomy, which is an input to the simulation model, and provide sensitivity analysis on related model parameters.\n\nRESULTS: The greatest gains in life expectancy result from conducting prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic oophorectomy immediately after BRCA1/2 mutation testing; these gains vary with age at testing, from 6.8 to 10.3 years for BRCA1 and 3.4 to 4.4 years for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Life expectancy gains from delaying prophylactic surgery by 5 to 10 years range from 1 to 9.9 years for BRCA1 and 0.5 to 4.2 years for BRCA2 mutation carriers. Adding annual breast screening provides gains of 2.0 to 9.9 years for BRCA1 and 1.5 to 4.3 years for BRCA2. Results were most sensitive to variations in our assumptions about the magnitude and duration of breast cancer risk reduction due to prophylactic oophorectomy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy gains depend on the type of BRCA mutation and age at interventions.

Recent studies have suggested an important developmental role for the murine homologue of BRCA1 in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. At the present time, however, little is known about the developmental role of BRCA2 or the regulation of its expression in vivo. We have determined the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of the murine homologue of BRCA2 during fetal development, in adult tissues, and in the mammary gland during postnatal development. Our results indicate that Brca2 mRNA expression is highest in proliferating cellular compartments, particularly those undergoing differentiation. In the breast, Brca2 expression is developmentally regulated and is induced during puberty and pregnancy and as a result of parity. Surprisingly, in multiple fetal and adult tissues the spatial and temporal pattern of Brca2 mRNA expression is virtually indistinguishable from that of Brca1, despite the fact that these genes display no homology. These observations suggest that Brca2 is involved in the processes of proliferation and differentiation in the mammary gland and other tissues, and that Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA expression may be regulated by similar pathways and stimuli in multiple cell types. Interestingly, however, our analysis reveals that Brca1 and Brca2 expression are differentially regulated during the development of specific endocrine target tissues, such as the testis during spermatogenesis and the breast during pregnancy. In addition, the ratio of mRNA expression in the mammary glands of adult females relative to adult males is significantly greater for Brca1 than for Brca2. These observations imply that Brca1 and Brca2 mRNA expression are differentially regulated by sex hormones. In order to test this hypothesis, we have analyzed the expression of these two breast cancer susceptibility genes in ovariectomized mice treated with 17beta-estradiol and progesterone. Our results demonstrate that the up-regulation of mRNA expression in the breast by ovarian hormones is significantly greater for Brca1 than for Brca2. These observations suggest that the gender-specific differences in phenotype associated with germline mutations in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 may be related to the differential regulation of these genes by sex hormones."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "11306454", "_score": 378.62714, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:major]", "Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 [D016159:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Ultraviolet Rays [D014466:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Cell Line [D002460:minor]", "Cycloheximide [D003513:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Down-Regulation [D015536:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:major]", "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors [D011500:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Signal Transduction [D015398:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]"], "text": "Ultraviolet irradiation induces BRCA2 protein depletion through a p53-independent and protein synthesis-dependent pathway.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that BRCA2, the protein product of the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, is involved in DNA damage repair.

To test this possibility, we examined the alteration of the BRCA2 protein level in human cell lines after UV irradiation. We found that UV irradiation down-regulated BRCA2 in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines tested. The down-regulation of BRCA2 occurred soon (within 4 h) after UV treatment. Surprisingly, down-regulation of BRCA2 by UV does not require functional p53, which has been suggested to be required for the down-regulation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs by DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, the proteosome- and calpain-mediated protein degradation pathways do not have an important role in the UV-induced BRCA2 depletion. However, blocking protein synthesis temporally inhibited the depletion of BRCA2 and BRCA1 in some cell lines. Ectopic expression of BRCA2 in cells increased resistance of cells to high-dose UV irradiation.

It encodes a nuclear protein that binds to the BRCA2 N-terminal domain implicated in chromatin/transcription regulation, but when sporadically amplified/overexpressed, increased EMSY level represses BRCA2 transactivation potential and induces chromosomal instability, mimicking the activity of BRCA2 mutations in the development of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. In addition to chromatin/transcription regulation, EMSY may also play a role in the DNA-damage response, suggested by its ability to localize at chromatin sites of DNA damage/repair. This implies that EMSY overexpression may also repress BRCA2 in DNA-damage replication/checkpoint and recombination/repair, coordinated processes that also require its interacting proteins: PALB2, the partner and localizer of BRCA2; RPA, replication/checkpoint protein A; and RAD51, the inseparable recombination/repair enzyme. Here, using a well-characterized recombination/repair assay system, we demonstrate that a slight increase in EMSY level can indeed repress these two processes independently of transcriptional interference/repression. Since EMSY, RPA and PALB2 all bind to the same BRCA2 region, these findings further support a scenario wherein: (a) EMSY amplification may mimic BRCA2 deficiency, at least by overriding RPA and PALB2, crippling the BRCA2/RAD51 complex at DNA-damage and replication/transcription sites; and (b) BRCA2/RAD51 may coordinate these processes by employing at least EMSY, PALB2 and RPA.

We also study the relationship between BRCA1/BRCA2 mutational status in male relatives affected with cancer (MAC) and, family history and tumor types. The study included 312 men index cases with family history of HBOCS and 61 MAC BRCA1/2 mutation-carriers. Family history, histological grade (HG), clinicopathological and immunohistochemistry data were collected. BRCA1/2 mutation analyses were performed by direct sequencing or screening methods and the large rearrangements by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. We found 49 mutation-carriers (15.7%), 95.9% with BRCA2 mutations. BRCA2 mutation-carriers were associated with families with at least one MBC and one BC in female (type II; p = 0.05). Strong association were found between the presence of pathogenic mutations in MBCs and the advanced HG (p = 0.003). c.658_659delTG, c.2808_2811delACAA, c.6275_6276delTT and c.9026_9030delATCAT were the most prevalent mutations. In 61 MAC we found 20 mutations in BRCA1 and 41 in BRCA2. For MAC we show that mutational status was differentially associated with family history (p = 0.018) and tumor type, being BRCA2 mutations linked with BC and prostatic cancer (p = 0.018). MBC caused by BRCA1/2 mutations define two types of MBCs. The most frequent caused by BRCA2 mutation linked to type II families and the rarest one attributed to BRCA1 mutation. Tumor associated with MAC suggest that only BRCA2 mutations have to do with a specific type of cancer (BC and prostatic cancer); but the linkage to tumors is questionable for BRCA1 mutations ."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "21294809", "_score": 378.291, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/etiology [Q000209:major]", "Risk Management [D012308:major]/methods [Q000379:minor]", "Risk Reduction Behavior [D040242:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/etiology [Q000209:major]", "Early Detection of Cancer [D055088:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Variation [D014644:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Cancer risk management decisions of women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants of uncertain significance."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "8917547", "_score": 378.24298, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Animals [D000818:minor]", "Epithelium [D004848:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Expression Regulation [D005786:major]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]", "Genetic Markers [D005819:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Hydrocortisone [D006854:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Insulin [D007328:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]", "Mice [D051379:minor]", "Mice, Transgenic [D008822:minor]", "Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]", "Prolactin [D011388:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]", "RNA, Messenger [D012333:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]", "Transcription, Genetic [D014158:major]", "Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast [D001940:minor]/cytology [Q000166:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]", "Cell Division [D002455:minor]", "Cell Line [D002460:minor]", "Epithelial Cells [D004847:minor]"], "text": "Brca2 is coordinately regulated with Brca1 during proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelial cells.\n\n\nWe have analyzed the expression of the breast cancer susceptibility gene, Brca2, in mammary epithelial cells as a function of proliferation and differentiation.

Here we show that human PALB2 binds DNA, preferentially D-loop structures, and directly interacts with the RAD51 recombinase to stimulate strand invasion, a vital step of homologous recombination. This stimulation occurs through reinforcing biochemical mechanisms, as PALB2 alleviates inhibition by RPA and stabilizes the RAD51 filament. Moreover, PALB2 can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion.

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of Aurora A overexpression on breast cancer arising in BRCA2 mutation carriers. Aurora A expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on breast tumour tissue microarrays from 107 BRCA2 999del5 mutation carriers and 284 of sporadic origin. Prognostic value of Aurora A nuclear staining was estimated in relation to clinical markers and adjuvant treatment, using multivariate Cox's proportional hazards ratio regression model. BRCA2 wild-type allele loss was measured by TaqMan in BRCA2 mutated tumour samples. All statistical tests were two sided. Multivariate analysis of breast cancer-specific survival, including proliferative markers and treatment, indicated independent prognostic value of Aurora A nuclear staining for BRCA2 mutation carriers (hazards ratio = 7.06; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-40.6; p = 0.028). Poor breast cancer-specific survival of BRCA2 mutation carriers was found to be significantly associated with combined Aurora A nuclear expression and BRCA2 wild type allele loss in tumours (p < 0.001).

The total number of genetic changes was almost two times higher in tumors from both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers than in the control group.

PALB2 performs its tumor suppressor role, at least in part, by supporting homologous recombination-type double strand break repair (HR-DSBR) through physical interactions with BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51. To further understand the mechanisms underlying PALB2-mediated DNA repair and tumor suppression functions, we targeted Palb2 in the mouse. Palb2-deficient murine ES cells recapitulated DNA damage defects caused by PALB2 depletion in human cells, and germ-line deletion of Palb2 led to early embryonic lethality. Somatic deletion of Palb2 driven by K14-Cre led to mammary tumor formation with long latency. Codeletion of both Palb2 and Tumor protein 53 (Trp53) accelerated mammary tumor formation. Like BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant breast cancers, these tumors were defective in RAD51 focus formation, reflecting a defect in Palb2 HR-DSBR function, a strongly suspected contributor to Brca1, Brca2, and Palb2 mammary tumor development. However, unlike the case of Brca1-mutant cells, Trp53bp1 deletion failed to rescue the genomic instability of Palb2- or Brca2-mutant primary lymphocytes. Therefore, Palb2-driven DNA damage control is, in part, distinct from that executed by Brca1 and more similar to that of Brca2.

Several risk factors have been identified which implicate estrogen-induced growth stimulation as a probable contributor to breast cancer pre-disposition. The protein products of both of these genes appear to help preserve genomic integrity via their participation in the DNA damage response and repair pathways. To date, the evidence for a cancer-protective role of dietary nutrients, for the most part those with antioxidant properties, has been based on women without any known genetic pre-disposition and it is important to identify and evaluate dietary factors which may modify the risk of cancer in BRCA carriers.

Several families, in which clustering but no mendelian inheritance exists, the BC is due probably to mutations in low penetrance genes and/or environmental factors. In families with autosomal dominant trait, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are frequently mutated. These genes are the two main BC susceptibility genes. BRCA1 predispose to BC and ovarian cancer, while BRCA2 mutations predispose to BC in men and women. Both are long genes, tumor suppressors, functioning in a cell cycle dependent manner, and it is believed that both switch on the transcription of several genes, and participate in DNA repair.

Cases were compared with 187 predominantly non-HBC cases. Tumors were assessed for histologic type, grade, and ploidy and S-phase fraction by quantitative DNA flow cytometry. Clinical presentation and available follow-up data were obtained.\n\nRESULTS: BRCA1-related and Other HBC patients each presented at lower stage (P = 0.003) and earlier age than non-HBC patients (mean, 42.8 years and 47.1 years vs. 62.9 years, P = 0.0001).

A nonsignificant trend toward better crude survival in both HBC groups was age- and stage-dependent.

Other HBC patients, despite neutral prognostic indicators, fared worse.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: BRCA1-related HBCs are more frequently aneuploid and have higher tumor cell proliferation rates compared with Other HBC. Despite these adverse prognostic features, BRCA1-related HBC patients have paradoxically lower recurrence rates than Other HBC patients.

To gain more insight into its role in homologous recombination, we expressed wild-type BRCA2 in the well-characterized BRCA2-deficient human cell line CAPAN-1 containing, as homologous recombination substrates, either direct or inverted repeats of two inactive marker genes. Whereas direct repeats monitor a mixture of RAD51-dependent and RAD51-independent homologous recombination events, inverted repeats distinguish between these events by reporting RAD51-dependent homologous recombination, gene conversion, and crossover events only. At either repeats, BRCA2 decreases the rate and frequency of spontaneous homologous recombination, but following chromosomal DSBs, BRCA2 increases the frequency of homologous recombination. At direct repeats, BRCA2 suppresses both spontaneous gene conversion and deletions, which can arise either from crossover or RAD51-independent sister chromatid replication slippage (SCRS), but following chromosomal DSBs, BRCA2 highly promotes gene conversion with little effect on deletions. At inverted repeats, spontaneous or DSB-induced crossover events were scarce and BRCA2 does not suppress their formation. From these results, we conclude that (i) BRCA2 regulates RAD51 recombination in response to the type of DNA damage and (ii) BRCA2 suppresses SCRS, suggesting a role for BRCA2 in sister chromatids cohesion and/or alignment.

Concordant LOH in both left and right tumours was demonstrated for at least one of the markers tested in 16/31(54%) cases. Where allelic loss was demonstrated for both left and right breast cancer, the same allele was lost on each occasion. This may suggest a common mutational event. Four cases showed concordant loss of alleles in both left and right breast cancer at D17S791 (BRCA1). BRCA1 mutations were identified in two of these cases where blood was available.

However, over time, the majority of these BRCA1/2-deficient cancers become resistant and patients die from refractory diseases. Three recent studies demonstrated that acquired resistance to platinum analogues or PARP inhibitors in tumors carrying frame-shift BRCA1/2 mutations came from restored BRCA1/2 expression and HR function due to secondary intragenic mutations that corrected the open reading frames of mutated BRCA1/2."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10652533", "_score": 377.18338, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Animals [D000818:minor]", "Mice [D051379:minor]", "Models, Genetic [D008957:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Transcription, Genetic [D014158:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Cell Cycle [D002453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "DNA Repair [D004260:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental [D018507:major]", "Humans [D006801:minor]"], "text": "Insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\n\nSince BRCA1 and BRCA2 were cloned five years ago, unraveling their normal functions has posed fascinating problems for cancer biologists.

Certain genetic factors can be highlighted as being of special importance in the response of breast cancers to treatment. The breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, determine the phenotype of the tumor, with BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient tumors showing marked sensitivity to ionizing radiation and drugs that produce double-strand breaks. However, the extent to which loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 function occurs in sporadic cancer has not yet been determined. The ATM protein plays a significant role in determining the response to therapy, but how frequently the function of ATM is disrupted in breast cancer is debated. Although the p53 protein is a major determinant of the response to ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs, there is no consistency in how p53 affects the survival of cells, because an impairment of DNA repair is offset by reduced apoptosis. Growth factors that sustain the proliferation of breast cancer cells may impact the response to therapy by inhibiting apoptosis. Loss of cell-cycle checkpoint responses may result in increased sensitivity, particularly if the checkpoint controls the G2 transition. Overexpression of cyclin D, which shortens the duration of the G1 transition, is associated with mild radiation resistance, perhaps by inhibiting apoptosis. Overall, there is much more to be understood in the complex response of breast cancers to therapy, and many other proteins play important roles in the response to treatment.

This study aims to evaluate the evidence of the effect of the BRCA1/2-carriership on CBC cumulative risk in female breast cancer patients. The literature was searched in Pubmed and Embase up to June 2013 for studies on CBC risk after a first primary invasive breast cancer in female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. A qualitative synthesis was carried out and the methodological quality of the studies evaluated. Cumulative risks of CBC after 5, 10 and 15 years since the first breast cancer diagnosis were pooled by BRCA1/2 mutation status. A total number of 20 articles, out of 1324 retrieved through the search, met the inclusion criteria: 18 retrospective and 2 prospective cohort studies. Cumulative risks of up to five studies were pooled. The cumulative 5-years risk of CBC for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers was 15% (95% CI: 9.5%-20%) and 9% (95% CI: 5%-14%), respectively. This risk increases with time since diagnosis of the first breast cancer; the 10-years risk increased up to 27% and 19%, respectively. The 5-years cumulative risk was remarkably lower in non-BRCA carriers (3%; 95% CI: 2%-5%) and remained so over subsequent years (5%; 95% CI: 3%-7%).

For breast cancer patients carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutations, the outcome of treatment with LRT with respect to IBTR has not been determined. In this study, we estimate the frequency of BRCA1/2 mutations in a study of breast cancer patients with IBTR treated with LRT.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1973 and 1994, there were 52 breast cancer patients treated with LRT who developed an IBTR within the prior irradiated breast and who were willing to participate in the current study. From our database, we also identified 52 control breast cancer patients treated with LRT without IBTR. The control patients were individually matched to the index cases with respect to multiple clinical and pathologic parameters. Lymphocyte DNA specimens from all 52 locally recurrent patients and 15 of the matched control patients under age 40 were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction amplification and dye-primer sequencing of exons 2 to 24 of BRCA1, exons 2 to 27 of BRCA2, and flanking intron sequences.\n\nRESULTS: After LRT, eight (15%) of 52 breast cancer patients had IBTR with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations. By age, there were six (40%) of 15 patients with IBTR under age 40 with BRCA1/2 mutations, one (9.0%) of 11 between ages 40 and 49, and one (3.8%) of 26 older than age 49. In comparison to the six (40%) of 15 of patients under age 40 with IBTR found to have BRCA1/2 mutations, only one (6.6%) of 15 matched control patients without IBTR and had a BRCA1/2 mutation (P =.03). The median time to IBTR for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations was 7.8 years compared with 4.7 years for patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (P =.03). By clinical and histologic criteria, these relapses represented second primary tumors developing in the conservatively treated breast. All patients with BRCA1/2 mutations and IBTR underwent successful surgical salvage mastectomy at the time of IBTR and remain alive without evidence of local or systemic progression of disease.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, we found an elevated frequency of deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations in breast cancer patients treated with LRT who developed late IBTR. The relatively long time to IBTR, as well as the histologic and clinical criteria, suggests that these recurrent cancers actually represent new primary breast cancers. Early onset breast cancer patients experiencing IBTR have a disproportionately high frequency of deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations. This information may be helpful in guiding management in BRCA1 or BRCA2 patients considering breast-conserving therapy."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15576832", "_score": 376.79486, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Loss of Heterozygosity [D019656:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Prognosis [D011379:minor]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]", "Gene Deletion [D017353:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]"], "text": "Differential association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes with some breast cancer-associated genes in early and late onset breast tumors.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicating more aggressive features of breast carcinoma (BC) in young women than their older counterparts have raised the question of whether these differences are present at the genetic level.\n\nMETHODS: For this purpose, we performed a comparative analysis of the frequency of deletions of BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCAX, TP53, ATM, and RB1 and amplification of Cyclin D1 and also studied the interrelation and prognostic significance of these genetic alterations in 30 early onset (< or =40 years) and 33 late onset (>40 years) cases of BC.

To determine whether genomic profiles similarly discriminate among BRCA1, BRCA2, and sporadic tumors, we established DNA copy number profiles using comparative genomic hybridization to BAC-clone microarrays providing <1 Mb resolution. Tumor DNA was obtained from BRCA1 (n = 14) and BRCA2 (n = 12) mutation carriers, as well as sporadic cases (n = 26). Overall, BRCA1 tumors had a higher frequency of copy number alterations than sporadic breast cancers (P = 0.00078). In particular, frequent losses on 4p, 4q, and 5q in BRCA1 tumors and frequent gains on 7p and 17q24 in BRCA2 tumors distinguish these from sporadic tumors. Distinct amplicons at 3q27.1-q27.3 were identified in BRCA1 tumors and at 17q23.3-q24.2 in BRCA2 tumors. A homozygous deletion on 5q12.1 was found in a BRCA1 tumor. Using a set of 169 BAC clones that detect significantly (P < 0.001) different frequencies of copy number changes in inherited and sporadic tumors, these could be discriminated into separate groups using hierarchical clustering. By comparing DNA copy number and RNA expression for genes in these regions, several candidate genes affected by up- or down-regulation were identified. Moreover, using support vector machines, we correctly classified BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors (P < 0.0000004 and 0.00005, respectively).

Humans who carry heterozygous germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene are highly predisposed to cancers of the breast, ovary, pancreas, prostate and other tissues. Here, we review recent studies that describe genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for pancreatic cancer associated with BRCA2 mutations. These studies not only surprisingly show that BRCA2 does not follow the classical Knudson \"two hit\" paradigm for tumour suppression, but also highlight features of the interplay between TP53 inactivation and carcinogenesis in the context of BRCA2 deficiency.

The provision of such advice has been hampered by a lack of appropriate data regarding the cancer risks. Chen and colleagues recently provided precise estimates of the relative risks of breast and ovarian cancer in almost 2000 kindreds with such mutations ascertained through familial cancer clinics across USA. The baseline incidence of breast cancer is lower in Australia than in North America. The relative risks derived from the study have been combined with Australian baseline incidence data to estimate the absolute short-term and long-term risks of breast and ovarian cancers for Australian carriers of different ages. The results are presented as a series of graphs that may be useful in counselling an unaffected carrier of a specified age. It is of note that the incidence of breast cancer in carriers is high in premenopausal women, but approaches the population incidence in postmenopausal women. Conversely, the incidence of ovarian cancer continues to increase from the age of 40 years. Among carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the cumulative lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 50-60% and the equivalent risk of ovarian cancer is 20-40%.

RRSO was associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (HR = 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37 to 0.65). Similar risk reductions were observed in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.64) and in BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.84). RRSO was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of BRCA1/2-associated ovarian or fallopian tube cancer (HR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.39). Data were insufficient to obtain separate estimates for ovarian or fallopian tube cancer risk reduction with RRSO in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers.\n\nCONCLUSION: The summary estimates presented here indicate that RRSO is strongly associated with reductions in the risk of breast, ovarian, and fallopian tube cancers and should provide guidance to women in planning cancer risk reduction strategies."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "10464625", "_score": 376.19214, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Jews [D007585:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Phenotype [D010641:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Frequency [D005787:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]"], "text": "Prevalence of recurring BRCA mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish women with breast cancer.\n\n\nThe BRCA1 mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the BRCA2 mutation 6174delT have been detected in a significant proportion of Ashkenazi Jewish women with early-onset breast cancer.

BRCA1 is important because of its checkpoint function at S and G\u2082/M phages in the DNA damage response, and controls the transcription of genes such as GADD45 or RNA poly II. BRCA1 also interacts with SWI/SNF and BACH1 to regulate chromatin re-modeling. BRCA2 is also multi-functional, and regulates the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in cooperation with the MRN complex and RPA. BRCA2 interacts with Rad51 to directly repair DNA damage. In addition, BRCA2 regulates cytokinesis and centrosome duplication. New treatment is developed with inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase(PARP)for BRCA-deficient cells. PARPs repair single-strand DNA breaks, and inhibition of PARPs is considered to break the replication fork and increase the effect of anti-cancer drugs. Inhibition of PARPs leads to the conversion of single-strand breaks(SSB)to double-strand breaks(DSB). Because BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells are unable to efficiently complete homologous recombination, PARP inhibition in these cells causes a high degree of genomic instability and eventual cell death termed \"synthetic lethality. \"This synthetic lethal approach has been validated in studies that show striking single-agent activity of PARP inhibitors in preclinical models of BRCA1 and BRCA2 inactivation."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "15546503", "_score": 376.17365, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Apoptosis [D017209:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:minor]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]", "Transcription, Genetic [D014158:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Cell Cycle [D002453:major]", "DNA Damage [D004249:minor]", "DNA Repair [D004260:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:minor]/physiology [Q000502:major]"], "text": "Role of BRCA1 and BRCA2 as regulators of DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle in response to DNA damage.\n\n\nBRCA1 (BReast-CAncer susceptibility gene 1) and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes, the mutant phenotypes of which predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. Intensive research has shown that BRCA proteins are involved in a multitude of pivotal cellular processes. In particular, both genes contribute to DNA repair and transcriptional regulation in response to DNA damage. Recent studies suggest that BRCA proteins are required for maintenance of chromosomal stability, thereby protecting the genome from damage. New data also show that BRCAs transcriptionally regulate some genes involved in DNA repair, the cell cycle, and apoptosis. Many of these functions are mediated by a large number of cellular proteins that interact with BRCAs. The functions of BRCA proteins are also linked to distinct and specific phosphorylation events; however, the extent to which phosphorylation-activated molecular pathways contribute to tumor suppressor activity remains unclear.

Based on its biological functions and association with RAD51C, there is reason to suggest that RAD51L1 (RAD51B/REC2) may also contain high risk mutations in the gene that give rise to multiple-case breast cancer families. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we have used high resolution melt (HRM) analysis to screen RAD51L1 for germline mutations in 188 non-BRCA1/2 multiple-case breast cancer families and 190 controls.

The expression level of BRCA2 is important for its DNA repair function in mammalian cells, and its expression level is linked to tumorigenesis in mammary tissue. However, the expression of canine BRCA2 in mammary tumors is unclear.\n\nRESULTS: BRCA2 mRNA levels were compared between seven mammary gland samples and seventeen mammary tumor samples isolated from dogs. The expression level of canine BRCA2 in mammary tumor samples was lower than levels in mammary gland samples. We attempted to identify why the BRCA2 expression level was decreased in mammary tumor samples by promoter sequencing analysis; however, we did not find any mutations in the canine BRCA2 promoter that altered BRCA2 transcription levels. We did detect two types of BRCA2 splice variants in 8 mammary tumor samples. One of the variants induced a frame-shift mutation that could lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a ubiquitous cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNA containing a premature termination codon.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Reduced expression of canine BRCA2 mRNA in mammary tumor samples is a possible mechanism to explain mammary tumor development in dogs. One possible reason for reduced BRCA2 mRNA levels in these tumor samples was nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, not mutations in the BRCA2 promoter region.

This finding suggests that among mutation carriers, physicians are influenced by adjuvant treatment guidelines more so than the potential role that tamoxifen might play in the reduction of risk for contralateral breast cancer."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "18489799", "_score": 375.2182, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Age of Onset [D017668:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Male [D008297:minor]", "Mutation [D009154:major]", "Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "BRCA1 Protein [D019313:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms, Male [D018567:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]", "Czech Republic [D018153:minor]", "DNA Mutational Analysis [D004252:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]"], "text": "Spectrum and characterisation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations in high-risk Czech patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer has doubled over the past 20 years in the Czech Republic.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations account for an important fraction of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer cases. One thousand and ten unrelated high-risk probands with breast and/or ovarian cancer were analysed for the presence of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Czech Republic) during 1999-2006.\n\nMETHODS: The complete coding sequences and splice sites of both genes were screened, and the presence of large intragenic rearrangements in BRCA1 was verified. Putative splice-site variants were analysed at the cDNA level for their potential to alter mRNA splicing.\n\nRESULTS: In 294 unrelated families (29.1% of the 1,010 probands) pathogenic mutations were identified, with 44 different BRCA1 mutations and 41 different BRCA2 mutations being detected in 204 and 90 unrelated families, respectively. In total, three BRCA1 founder mutations (c.5266dupC; c.3700_3704del5; p.Cys61Gly) and two BRCA2 founder mutations (c.7913_7917del5; c.8537_8538del2) represent 52% of all detected mutations in Czech high-risk probands.

Large rearrangements are less frequent in the BRCA2 gene than in BRCA1. We report, here, the first total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast/ovarian cancer families for BRCA2 large rearrangements. Deletion of exon 3, which is in phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels of alternative transcripts lacking exon 3 (\u03943 delta3 transcript) have been reported in normal tissues, which raises the question whether deletion of exon 3 is pathogenic.\n\nMETHODS: Large BRCA2 rearrangements were analysed by QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments) or MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification). The exon 3 deletion was characterized with a \"zoom-in\" dedicated CGH array to the BRCA2 gene and sequencing. To determine the effect of exon 3 deletion and assess its pathogenic effect, three methods of transcript quantification were used: fragment analysis of FAM-labelled PCR products, specific allelic expression using an intron 2 polymorphism and competitive quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nRESULTS: Large rearrangements of BRCA2 were detected in six index cases out of 2058 tested (3% of all deleterious BRCA2 mutations). This study reports the first large rearrangement of the BRCA2 gene that includes all of exon 3 and leads to an in frame deletion of exon 3 at the transcriptional level. Thirty five variants in exon 3 and junction regions of BRCA2 are also reported, that contribute to the interpretation of the pathogenicity of the deletion. The quantitative approaches showed that there are three classes of delta3 BRCA2 transcripts (low, moderate and exclusive). Exclusive expression of the delta3 transcript by the mutant allele and segregation data provide evidence for a causal effect of the exon 3 deletion.\n\nCONCLUSION: This paper highlights that large rearrangements and total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene could contribute to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that, to interpret the pathogenic effect of any variants of exon 3, both accurate transcript quantification and co-segregation analysis are required."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "9653432", "_score": 374.76108, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Aged [D000368:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Genetic Linkage [D008040:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Pedigree [D010375:minor]", "Point Mutation [D017354:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]", "Alleles [D000483:minor]", "BRCA2 Protein [D024682:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 [D002882:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 [D002886:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Exons [D005091:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]"], "text": "Breast cancer susceptibility genes.

It is estimated that 3%-8% of all women with breast cancer will be found to carry a mutation in 1 of these genes. Families with multiple affected first-degree relatives and patients with early-onset disease have been found to harbor mutations at a higher frequency. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for large proteins that bear no resemblance to other known genes. In the cell, they appear to act as tumor suppressor genes and play a role in the maintenance of genome integrity, although the precise function of these genes has yet to be discovered. A large number of distinct mutations have been found in cancer families around the world. The majority of the defined pathologic mutations result in premature truncation of the protein (frameshift and nonsense mutations). These mutations may substantially increase the risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but a precise risk estimate for each different mutation cannot be determined. Depending on the familial context, the risk of breast cancer associated with carrying a mutation has been estimated to range from 50% to 85%. The role of these genes in sporadic cancer remains unknown. Patients and physicians considering BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing are faced with a difficult decision. The diversity of mutations and lack of general population data prevent accurate risk prediction.

BRCA1 can directly interact with the androgen receptor (AR) and Janus kinase (JAK), and can differentially regulate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-IR) expression in an AR-dependent manner. BRCA2 homeostasis in prostate cancer cells has been found to be critical in determining cell fates during prostate cancer progression. This review may be helpful for medical professionals and prostate cancer patients when discussing prostate cancer risks, treatment and prognosis."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "19210013", "_score": 374.7106, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Adult [D000328:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Mastectomy [D008408:minor]", "Middle Aged [D008875:minor]", "Patient Satisfaction [D017060:major]", "Risk Assessment [D018570:minor]", "Aged [D000368:minor]", "Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]", "Decision Making [D003657:major]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:major]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:major]", "Genetic Counseling [D005817:minor]", "Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]/psychology [Q000523:major]"], "text": "Randomized trial of a decision aid for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers: impact on measures of decision making and satisfaction.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: Genetic testing is increasingly part of routine clinical care for women with a family history of breast cancer. Given their substantially elevated risk for breast cancer, BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers must make the difficult decision whether or not to opt for risk reducing mastectomy. To help BRCA1/2 carriers make this decision, the authors developed a computer-based interactive decision aid that was tested against usual care in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nDESIGN: After the completion of genetic counseling, 214 female (aged 21-75) BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers were randomized to Usual Care (UC; N = 114) or Usual Care plus Decision Aid (DA; N = 100) arms. UC participants received no additional intervention. DA participants were sent the CD-ROM DA to view at home.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The authors measured final management decision, decisional conflict, decisional satisfaction, and receipt of risk reducing mastectomy at 1-, 6-, and 12-months postrandomization.\n\nRESULTS: Longitudinal analyses revealed that the DA was effective among carriers who were initially undecided about how to manage their breast cancer risk. Within this group, the DA led to an increased likelihood of reaching a management decision (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.62, 5.90; p < .001), decreased decisional conflict (B = -.46, z = -3.1, p <002), and increased satisfaction (B = .27, z = 3.1, p = .002) compared to UC. Among carriers who had already made a management decision by the time of randomization, the DA had no benefit relative to UC.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers who are having difficulty making a breast cancer risk management decision can benefit from adjunct decision support."}}, {"_index": "abstracts", "_type": "abstracts", "_id": "20815029", "_score": 374.68726, "_source": {"mesh_terms": ["Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:major]", "Genotype [D005838:minor]", "Humans [D006801:minor]", "Phenotype [D010641:minor]", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide [D020641:minor]", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2 [D051497:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]", "Risk [D012306:minor]", "Risk Factors [D012307:minor]", "Cluster Analysis [D016000:major]", "Family Health [D005192:minor]", "Female [D005260:minor]", "Genes, BRCA1 [D019398:minor]", "Genes, BRCA2 [D024522:minor]", "Genetic Association Studies [D056726:major]", "Genetic Linkage [D008040:minor]", "Genetic Markers [D005819:major]"], "text": "Familial concordance of breast cancer pathology as an indicator of genotype in multiple-case families.\n\n\nThe heterogeneity of multiple case breast cancer families that do not carry mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (non-BRCA1/2 families) poses a challenge to the identification of breast cancer susceptibility genes. The aim of this study was to determine whether intrafamilial concordance in breast cancer pathology could identify subgroups of non-BRCA1/2 families with consistent genotypic features. Invasive breast cancers were reviewed from 84 individuals belonging to 30 multiple-case families; BRCA1 (n = 9), BRCA2 (n = 10), and non-BRCA1/2 (n = 11). Hierarchical cluster analysis based on histopathology and age at first diagnosis was then used to specify three subgroups designated Clusters 1-3. The genomic features of non-BRCA1/2 families were examined by genome wide linkage and FGFR2 SNP genotyping, according to whether they showed cluster-concordant or cluster-mixed familial pathology. The majority of pathogenic BRCA1 mutation carriers (80%) fell into a single cluster. In contrast pathogenic BRCA2 mutation carriers were distributed across all three clusters and within families, cluster groups were also generally mixed. Most non-BRCA1/2 mutation carriers belonged to Cluster 3 (71%). Genome wide linkage data from five non-BRCA1/2 Cluster 3-concordant families were compared with four mixed cluster non-BRCA1/2 families. This revealed a number of distinct linkage peaks, including some regions previously associated with breast cancer susceptibility.

Most BRCA2 germline mutations introduce premature termination codons (PTCs), making their mRNAs likely targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a mechanism that eliminates PTC-bearing transcripts to prevent expression of truncated proteins. Contradictory evidence exists regarding whether NMD can be triggered by PTCs located far upstream of the nearest exon-exon junction (EEJ). Since the OCCR comprises a major portion of the 4.9 kb exon 11 of BRCA2, we investigated if transcripts bearing PTCs in this large exon are unable to trigger NMD, and if this might contribute to the phenotypic difference associated with the OCCR. We examined cDNA from 18 carriers of PTC-introducing germline mutations located throughout BRCA2, and found that PTC-bearing transcripts were 1.4-3.3-fold less prevalent than their nonmutated counterparts irregardless of PTC position.

The risk increases with increasing numbers and decreasing age of onset of affected relatives. In families with a BRCA1 or a BRCA2 mutation, individual carrier status predicts the risk of breast cancer. In relatives of cases where both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are excluded, the risk remains undetermined.\n\nMETHODS: Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and cumulative cancer incidences were calculated for relatives of a population-based set of early-onset breast cancer index cases (younger than age 41 years) with a defined BRCA mutation status (n = 203).\n\nRESULTS: In first-degree relatives (FDRs) of mutation-negative cases, breast cancer incidences (SIR = 2.3), prostate cancer incidences (SIR = 1.7), cervix cancer incidences (SIR = 3.3) and nonmelanoma skin cancer incidences (SIR = 2.8) were increased. The risks of breast cancer, prostate cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer were further increased in FDRs of breast cancer cases younger than 36 years of age. In high-risk individuals with at least one relative with breast cancer apart from the index case, but no BRCA mutation in the family, breast cancer incidence was increased (SIR = 5.3); again the prostate cancer incidence was elevated (SIR = 2.5). The cumulative incidence of breast cancer at ages 50 and 70 years for FDRs of index cases without a BRCA mutation was 3.6% and 12.8%, respectively. Similarly, the cumulative incidence of breast cancer for high-risk women was 6.3% and 21.1% at ages 50 and 70 years, and that for FDRs of BRCA mutation carriers was 17.2% and 27.7% at the same ages.\n\nCONCLUSION: The incidence of breast cancer is increased for FDRs of women with early-onset breast cancer irrespective of the BRCA status in the family. Risk increases with decreasing age and with increasing number of affected relatives.

We investigated the effect of treating normal and cancer cells with physiologically relevant FA concentrations on the mRNA and protein expression, capacity for DNA repair, and DNA methylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2.

For carriers of these mutations, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy significantly reduces morbidity and mortality. Population screening for these mutations among AJ women may be justifiable if accurate estimates of cancer risk for mutation carriers can be obtained. We therefore undertook to determine risks of breast and ovarian cancer for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers ascertained irrespective of personal or family history of cancer. Families harboring mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 were ascertained by identifying mutation carriers among healthy AJ males recruited from health screening centers and outpatient clinics. Female relatives of the carriers were then enrolled and genotyped. Among the female relatives with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, cumulative risk of developing either breast or ovarian cancer by age 60 and 80, respectively, were 0.60 (\u00b1 0.07) and 0.83 (\u00b1 0.07) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.33 (\u00b1 0.09) and 0.76 (\u00b1 0.13) for BRCA2 carriers.

We show how a polymorphism in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of BRCA2 can serve as one such factor. Based on the hypothesis that variants of genes involved in the same pathway can influence the risk provided for breast cancer, the status of p53 codon 72 polymorphism was also investigated and a possible interaction between the polymorphisms was examined.\n\nMETHODS: The luciferase reporter assay followed by RNA secondary structure analysis was used for the functional characterization of -26 5' UTR G>A polymorphism in BRCA2. The genotype and the allele frequency for the polymorphisms were determined and relative risk adjusted for age was calculated in a case-control study of 576 individuals (243 patients and 333 controls) from north India.\n\nRESULTS: -26 G>A polymorphism in the 5' UTR of BRCA2 was found to be functional whereby the A allele increased the reporter gene expression by twice that of the G allele in MCF-7 (P = 0.003) and HeLa (P = 0.013) cells. RNA secondary structure analysis by two different programs predicted the A allele to alter the stability of a loop in the vicinity of the translation start site. Its direct implication in breast cancer became evident by a case-control study in which the heterozygous genotype was found to be protective in nature (P heterozygote advantage model = 0.0005, odds ratio [OR] = 0.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4 to 0.8), which was further supported by trends observed in a genomic instability study. The p53 codon 72 Arg homozygous genotype was found to be over-represented in patients (P = 0.0005, OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.4 to 3.6). The interaction study indicated an increased protection under simultaneous presence of protector genotypes of both the polymorphic loci (P = 0.0001, OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1 to 0.4).\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows that -26 5' UTR polymorphism in BRCA2 can modulate the fine-tuned regulation of the multifunctional gene BRCA2 and renders risk or protection according to the genotype status in the sporadic form of breast cancer, which is further influenced by the germline genetic backgrounds of codon 72 polymorphism of p53."}}]
