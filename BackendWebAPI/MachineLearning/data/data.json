Our goal was to determine whether the absence of CDK4 amplification was (a) correlated to a specific clinico-histopathologic profile; and (b) compensated by another genomic anomaly involving the CCND1/CDK4/P16INK4a/RB1/E2F pathway.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the clinical characteristics of a series of 143 WDLPS/DDLPS with amplification of both MDM2 and CDK4 (MDM2+/CDK4+) to a series of 45 WDLPS/DDLPS with MDM2 amplification and no CDK4 amplification (MDM2+/CDK4-). We used fluorescence in situ hybridization, real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR, and immunohistochemistry to explore the status of CCND1, P16INK4a, P14ARF, and RB1.\n\nRESULTS: We found that MDM2+/CDK4- WDLPS/DDLPS represent a distinct clinical subgroup with favorable prognostic features, including low-grade lipoma-like histology, peripheral location, and lower rate of recurrence. By using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that genomic aberrations expected to be alternative mechanisms for compensating the lack of CDK4 amplification, such as RB1 and CDKN2A deletions or CCND1 amplification, were very uncommon. In contrast, by using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR and immunohistochemistry, we observed that overexpression of P16INK4a (and P14ARF) and CCND1 and reduced expression of RB1 were very frequent, independently of the CDK4 status.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results underscore the complex coordinated regulation of the RB and p53 growth-control pathways in WDLPS/DDLPS. Because the absence of CDK4 amplification is not specifically counterbalanced by a genomic alteration of the CCND1/CDK4/P16INK4a/RB1/E2F pathway, CDK4 amplification may only represent a "MDM2-HMGA2-helper" in WDLPS/DDLPS tumorigenesis.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25679065', '_score': 607.8336, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adipose Tissue [D000273:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction [D060885:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Paraffin Embedding [D016612:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Reproducibility of Results [D015203:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Tissue Fixation [D016707:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Feasibility Studies [D005240:minor]', 'Formaldehyde [D005557:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]'], 'text': 'Detection of MDM2/CDK4 amplification in lipomatous soft tissue tumors from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue: comparison of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\n\n\nIn this study, the detection of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was evaluated in lipomatous soft tissue tumors using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a PCR-based technique, in comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These 2 techniques were evaluated in a series of 77 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lipomatous tumors (27 benign adipose tumors, 28 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas, 18 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and 4 pleomorphic liposarcomas). Using MLPA, with a cut-off ratio of >2, 36/71 samples (22 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas, and 14 dedifferentiated liposarcomas) showed MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. Using FISH as gold standard, MLPA showed a sensitivity of 90% (36/40) and a specificity of 100% (31/31) in detecting amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in lipomatous soft tissue tumors. In case of high-level amplification (MDM2-CDK4/CEP12 ratio >5), concordance was 100%. Four cases of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (4/26, 15%) with a low MDM2 and CDK4 amplification level (MDM2-CDK4/CEP12 ratio ranging between 2 and 2.5) detected by FISH showed no amplification by MLPA, although gain of MDM2 and CDK4 (ratios ranging between 1.6 and 1.9) was seen with MLPA. No amplification was detected in benign lipomatous tumors and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Furthermore, there was a very high concordance between the ratios obtained by FISH and MLPA. In conclusion, MLPA proves to be an appropriate and straightforward technique for screening MDM2/CDK4 amplification in lipomatous tumors, especially when a correct cut-off value and reference samples are chosen, and could be considered a good alternative to FISH to determine MDM2 and CDK4 amplification in liposarcomas. Moreover, because MLPA, as a multiplex technique, allows simultaneous detection of multiple chromosomal changes of interest, it could be in the future a very reliable and fast molecular analysis on paraffin-embedded material to test for other diagnostically, prognostically, or therapeutically relevant genomic mutations in lipomatous tumors.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '26336885', '_score': 605.40375, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'HMGA2 Protein [D025743:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate [D053208:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun) [D016759:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization [D055028:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:major]', 'Genes, jun [D016758:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]'], 'text': "Prognostic value of HMGA2, CDK4, and JUN amplification in well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas.\n\n\nHMGA2, CDK4, and JUN genes have been described as frequently coamplified with MDM2 in atypical lipomatous tumor, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma. We studied the frequency of amplification of these genes in a series of 48 dedifferentiated liposarcomas and 68 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. We correlated their amplification status with clinicopathological features and outcomes. Histologically, both CDK4 (P=0.007) and JUN (P=0.005) amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, whereas amplification of the proximal parts of HMGA2 (5'-untranslated region (UTR) and exons 1-3) was associated with atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (P=0.01). CDK4 amplification was associated with axial tumors. Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 of HMGA2 was associated with primary status and grade 1.

Amplification of 5'-UTR and exons 1-3 (P=0.08) and 3'-UTR (P=0.01) of HMGA2 were associated with longer recurrence-free survival. Distant metastasis was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival (HR=5.8) in multivariate analysis.

In conclusion, we showed that the amplification of HMGA2 was associated with the atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma histological type and a good prognosis, whereas CDK4 and JUN amplifications were associated with dedifferentiated liposarcoma histology and a bad prognosis.

We examined a series of 559 soft tissue tumors (44 ALT-WDLPS, 61 DDLPS, 49 benign adipose tumors, and 405 non-ALT-WDLPS/DDLPS sarcomas) for MDM2 and CDK4 expression using immunohistochemistry.

WDL characteristically harbor amplifications of the MDM2 and CDK4 cell cycle oncogenes and overexpress the cell cycle regulator p16. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to assess for MDM2 and CDK4 gene amplification is the diagnostic gold standard, and immunohistochemistry for the overexpressed MDM2 and CDK4 proteins is also useful but may not be routinely offered by pathology laboratories. p16 immunohistochemistry is a sensitive marker for WDL and is in the repertoire of most laboratories, and it has been suggested as a useful method of distinguishing WDL from lipomas when other ancillary modalities are not readily available. We describe a case of a large retroperitoneal adipocytic mass occurring in a 27-year-old male, which was clinically and radiologically in keeping with WDL. Histologically this was a differentiated adipocytic neoplasm with prominent fibrous septa and fat necrosis, more suggestive of retroperitoneal lipoma. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse, strong nuclear expression of p16 in the areas of fat necrosis. However, CDK4 was negative and the lesion lacked evidence of MDM2 amplification with FISH. Diffuse expression of p16 in areas of fat necrosis in large or deep lipomas highlights the potential for diagnostic misinterpretation as well differentiated liposarcoma, and we therefore emphasize that p16 immunohistochemistry should always be interpreted as part of a panel with CDK4 +/- MDM2 in the differential diagnosis of WDL and lipoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '12640106', '_score': 528.59, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:major]', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization [D009693:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases [D018844:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': 'Most malignant fibrous histiocytomas developed in the retroperitoneum are dedifferentiated liposarcomas: a review of 25 cases initially diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma.\n\n\nForty-four samples from 25 cases of retroperitoneal sarcoma initially diagnosed as malignant fibrous histiocytoma were histologically reviewed.

It is also reported that the CDK4 gene is coamplified with other sequences in the 12q13-15 region, including the MDM2 and SAS genes. Using 146 DNA samples derived from a variety of bone and soft tissue tumors, we have studied the pattern of amplification of these three genes, CDK4, MDM2, and SAS, to investigate whether there are any tumor type specific patterns of amplification. Amplification of at least one of these three genes was found in 18 tumors, and five different patterns of amplification were observed. Amplification of all of these three genes was detected in 9 cases. Amplification of the CDK4 gene without MDM2 amplification was observed in osteosarcomas and a chondrosarcoma but not in soft tissue tumors, whereas amplification of MDM2 gene alone was observed in malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), liposarcomas, and lipomas, but not in bone tumors. These results suggested that the CDK4 region is the primary target for amplification in bone tumors, whereas the MDM2 region is in soft tissue tumors. We also investigated the relationship of CDK4 amplification with retinoblastoma (RB) gene mutations in osteosarcomas, for which we have already performed the mutation analyses in detail. Interestingly, contrary to the prevailing theory that CDK4 amplification is an alternative mechanism for RB gene mutation, we found that three of four cases with amplification of the CDK4 gene showed loss of expression of the RB protein, one of which was proved to have an gross DNA alteration in the RB locus.

In this study, we explored the role of CDK4 and the effects of NVP-LEE011 (LEE011), a novel selective inhibitor of CDK4/CDK6, on a panel of human liposarcoma cell lines and primary tumor xenografts. We found that both CDK4 knockdown by siRNA and inhibition by LEE011 diminished retinoblastoma (RB) phosphorylation and dramatically decreased liposarcoma cell growth. Cell-cycle analysis demonstrated arrest at G0-G1. siRNA-mediated knockdown of RB rescued the inhibitory effects of LEE011, demonstrating that LEE011 decreased proliferation through RB. Oral administration of LEE011 to mice bearing human liposarcoma xenografts resulted in approximately 50% reduction in tumor (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake with decreased tumor biomarkers, including RB phosphorylation and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in vivo.

Moreover, this feature may have consequences for treatment choice and prognosis. Here, we have dissected the molecular relation of tumor components in cases of mixed-type liposarcoma. On the basis of heterogeneous preoperative magnetic resonance image (MRI) features, eight cases of mixed-type liposarcoma were selected. Preoperative biopsy samples and resection specimens were analyzed including molecular and immunohistochemical analysis on all components. As controls, cases with homogeneous MRI features and uniform aspects of myxoid liposarcoma (n = 5), round cell liposarcoma (n = 5) and well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 5) were studied. All patients with heterogeneous MRI features showed morphological components of myxoid liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed FUS-DDIT3 fusion in both components in five of eight cases in the absence (zero of five) of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. In three of eight patients, MDM2 and/or CDK4 were overexpressed, and amplification was shown by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the absence of myxoid liposarcoma translocations. All control patients showed a molecular pattern consistent with their morphological features. Therefore, mixed-type liposarcomas should not be regarded as collision tumors, but as an extreme variant of the morphological spectrum within a single biological entity, explaining the biological contradiction of mixed-type liposarcoma.

In addition, using quantitative RT-PCR we studied the expression of MDM2, CDK4, DDIT3 (CHOP/GADD153), DYRK2, HMGA2, TSPAN31 and YEATS4 (GAS41) in 11 cases. We showed that CDK4 (12q14.1) belonged to a distinct amplicon than MDM2 (12q15). There was no continuity in the amplified sequences between MDM2 and CDK4. Moreover, while MDM2 was amplified and overexpressed in all cases, CDK4 was not amplified or overexpressed in 13% of cases. The centromeric border of the CDK4 amplicon was located immediately downstream the 5' end of DDIT3, a gene known for being involved in myxoid liposarcoma translocations. DDIT3 was amplified in 3 cases and overexpressed in 9 cases. The overexpression of DDIT3 was correlated to the CDK4 amplification and not to its own amplification status. This suggested that the CDK4 amplicon, as well as the overexpression of DDIT3, might be generated by the disruption of a fragile region in 5' DDIT3. HMGA2 was always amplified and rearranged indicating that it plays a central role in WDLPS/DDLPS. HMGA2 rearrangement frequently resulted in a loss of the 3' end region that is a binding site for let-7.

The CDK 4/6 inhibitors are a novel class of therapeutics that target the CDK 4/6 kinases that promote transition through the cell cycle.

These oral agents offer the hope of clinical efficacy in many tumor types, and have been associated with minimal toxicity.

DDLPS is a nonlipogenic sarcoma characterized by amplification of MDM2 and CDK4. PLPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts, characterized by a complex karyotype and a more aggressive clinical course. Rarely, DDLPS shows lipogenic differentiation, mimicking PLPS. The cytomorphologic features of DDLPS and PLPS and the utility of ancillary studies have not been systemically analyzed.\n\nMETHODS: Cytologic preparations of 25 DDLPS and 13 PLPS, all histologically confirmed, were retrospectively reviewed along with clinical and cytogenetic data. Sample cellularity, vascular architecture, background material, predominant cell morphology, quality of the cytoplasm, and nuclear pleomorphism were compared for both tumor types. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was performed on cell blocks and/or core needle biopsies.\n\nRESULTS: Fine-needle aspirate smears from both DDLPS and PLPS were variably cellular, composed of cellular clusters and noncohesive cells. Abundant myxoid stroma was present in ∼25% of DDLPS and PLPS cases, whereas branching curvilinear vessels were more common in DDLPS than in PLPS (7 of 25 versus 2 of 13). Tumors were composed of predominantly spindled (18 of 25 DDLPS versus 3 of 13 PLPS) or epithelioid cells (7 of 25 DDLPS versus 6 of 13 PLPS). Pleomorphic cells were predominant in 3 PLPS, and were frequent in both (13 of 25 DDLPS versus 10 of 13 PLPS). The cytoplasm was mostly fibrillary and often vacuolated in both entities. Other features included necrosis, mitoses, and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate. The main cytologic differences were the presence of marked pleomorphism, abundant lipoblasts, and cells with microvacuolated cytoplasm in most PLPS. A total of 24 (96%) and 20 (80%) cases of DDLPS expressed MDM2 and CDK4, respectively, whereas none of the PLPS expressed both markers. Six DDLPS tested showed ring or giant marker chromosomes and/or MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization; 2 PLPS had complex karyotypes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: DDLPS and PLPS exhibit variable and occasionally overlapping cytologic features. The presence of lipoblasts, cells with microvacuolated cytoplasm, and marked pleomorphism are more suggestive of PLPS, but these characteristics can be present in DDLPS.

Rarely, however, primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma is classified as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, based on the presence of myxoid areas and vascular crow's feet pattern, which has resulted in a debate on the classification of liposarcoma in the retroperitoneum. Genetically, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma and well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma are different diseases. Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is characterized by a translocation causing FUS-CHOP or EWSR1-CHOP fusion, whereas well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is characterized by an amplification of the 12q13-15 region, including MDM2 and CDK4 genes. As myxoid/round cell liposarcoma is highly radio- and chemosensitive, differentiation between subtypes is important to optimize treatment. We studied whether primary retroperitoneal liposarcomas diagnosed as myxoid/round cell liposarcoma represent molecularly true myxoid/round cell liposarcoma or are histopathological mimics and represent well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=16) were compared to primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (n=20). Histopathological and immunohistochemical features were studied. Amplification status of the 12q13-15 region was studied using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, and FUS-CHOP or EWS-CHOP translocations were studied using RT-PCR. In primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 and CDK4 staining was both positive in 12 of 15 cases. In primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcoma, MDM2 was negative in 18/20 and CDK4 was negative in all cases. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification showed the amplification of 12q13-15 region in 16/16 primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas and in 1/20 primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. Translocation was present in all (18/18) primary extremity myxoid/round cell liposarcomas, but absent in all primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcomas. On the basis of immunohistochemical and molecular characteristics, apparent primary retroperitoneal myxoid/round cell liposarcoma can be recognized as well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with morphological features mimicking myxoid/round cell liposarcoma. In these cases, treatment should probably be specifically designed as for well-/dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

WDL and DDL characteristically harbor amplifications of the MDM2 and CDK4 cell cycle oncogenes with protein overexpression and can also overexpress the cell cycle regulator p16. We assessed the utility of immunohistochemistry for CDK4, MDM2, and p16 in the routine histopathologic diagnosis of WDL/DDL from other adipocytic tumors. Immunohistochemistry for the trio of markers was performed on 216 adipocytic neoplasms (31 WDLs, 57 DDLs, 11 myxoid LPS, 2 pleomorphic LPS, 91 lipomas (including intramuscular, fibro, angio, and ossifying subtypes), 18 spindle/pleomorphic lipomas, and 6 hibernomas.

Heterologous differentiation commonly resembles well-differentiated or pleomorphic liposarcoma. In extramammary sites, these subtypes have different biological behaviours and distinct genetic alterations: MDM2 and CDK4 amplification in well-differentiated liposarcoma, and polyploidy with complex structural rearrangements in pleomorphic liposarcoma. The aim of this study was to investigate foci resembling well-differentiated liposarcoma in MPT for MDM2 and CDK4 amplification.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the clinicopathological characteristics of MPTs received by the Vanderbilt Breast Consultation Service containing components resembling well-differentiated or pleomorphic liposarcoma. Cases with available tissue blocks were subjected to fluorescence in-situ hybridization with MDM2 and CDK4 probes. Thirty-eight MPTs with liposarcomatous components were available for review. The mean patient age was 49.8 years (range 26-84 years). In addition to well-differentiated liposarcoma, the following components were also present: high-grade undifferentiated sarcoma (n = 9; 23.7%), pleomorphic liposarcoma (n = 4; 10.5%), non-high-grade sarcoma not otherwise specified (n = 22; 57.9%), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour-like (n = 2; 5.2%).

Amplification of chromosomal region 12q13-q14, which contains the CDK4 proto-oncogene, was identified in an aggressive subset of fusion-positive RMS. CDK4/6 inhibitors have antiproliferative activity in CDK4-amplified liposarcoma and neuroblastoma, suggesting CDK4/6 inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in fusion-positive RMS.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the biologic consequences of CDK4 knockdown, CDK4 overexpression, and pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition by LEE011 in fusion-positive RMS cell lines and xenografts.\n\nRESULTS: Knockdown of CDK4 abrogated proliferation and transformation of 12q13-14-amplified and nonamplified fusion-positive RMS cells via G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. This arrest was mediated by reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F-responsive gene expression. Significant differences in E2F target expression, cell-cycle distribution, proliferation, or transformation were not observed in RMS cells overexpressing CDK4. Treatment with LEE011 phenocopied CDK4 knockdown, decreasing viability, RB phosphorylation, and E2F-responsive gene expression and inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. Although all fusion-positive cell lines showed sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition, there was diminished sensitivity associated with CDK4 amplification and overexpression. This variable responsiveness to LEE011 was recapitulated in xenograft models of CDK4-amplified and nonamplified fusion-positive RMS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that CDK4 is necessary but overexpression is not sufficient for RB-E2F-mediated G1-phase cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and transformation in fusion-positive RMS. Our studies indicate that LEE011 is active in the setting of fusion-positive RMS and suggest that low CDK4-expressing fusion-positive tumors may be particularly susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibition.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '14736600', '_score': 471.8716, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Radiotherapy [D011878:minor]', 'Vulvar Neoplasms [D014846:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases [D018844:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]'], 'text': '[Atypical lipomatous tumour of the vulva.

To evaluate the accuracy of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in the differential diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors, we investigated MDM2-CDK4 status by FISH, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)] and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a series of 200 adipose tumors. First, we evaluated MDM2-CDK4 amplification and expression in a series of 94 well-defined adipose tissue tumors. Results showed that FISH was interpretable in 45 of 50 cases (90%), and was more specific and sensitive than Q-PCR and IHC. We then used the same techniques as complementary diagnostic tools in a series of 106 adipose and soft tissue tumors of unclear diagnosis to distinguish between (i) lipomas and atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcomas, (ii) malignant undifferentiated tumors and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and (iii) a variety of benign tumors and liposarcomas. Our results indicate that although helpful, IHC alone is often insufficient to solve diagnostic problems. FISH and Q-PCR methods gave concordant results and were equally informative in most cases. However, the proportion of noninterpretable cases was slightly higher with FISH than with Q-PCR. When tumor cells represented a minor component of the tumor tissue, such as with inflammatory tumors, FISH was more powerful than Q-PCR by allowing visualization of individual cells.

The well-differentiated and dedifferentiated family of liposarcomas demonstrates amplification of the chromosome subregion 12q13-q15 with resultant amplification of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes. However, the specific genetic changes that distinguish between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas are less well understood. To study the genetic changes in dedifferentiated liposarcomas, paired well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components of 29 tumors were analyzed separately by array-based comparative genomic hybridization. A bacterial artificial chromosome array at approximately 1-Mb resolution was used. The genetic changes were compared with clinical presentation, grade of the dedifferentiated component and overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4. Most tumors (n=21, 72%) were retroperitoneal, with both components present at initial diagnosis (n=25, 86%). Eight tumors (28%) were classified as low-grade dedifferentiation. In four cases (14%), a well-differentiated liposarcoma preceded the presentation of the dedifferentiated tumor by 1-5 years. 12q13-q15 was amplified in all tumors. Using unsupervised hierarchical clustering of copy-number changes, all but two tumors showed close similarities between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components, and segregated as pairs. Dedifferentiated components had more total amplifications (P=0.008) and a trend for gain at 19q13.2, but no genetic changes were significant in distinguishing between the two components.

Presentation and grade correlated with the frequency of changes at a number of genetic loci (P<0.001), whereas CDK4 immunostaining showed negative correlation with 12q13.13 amplification. The genotypic similarity, at the limit of the array's resolution, between components implies that most genetic changes precede phenotypic 'progression,' early in tumorigenesis.

Finally, a dramatic increase of adipocytic differentiation was noted in cells that have eliminated copies of CDK4 gene in micronuclei.

The goal of the present study was to identify, besides the well-known candidate genes, novel relevant genes in these large, complex 12q amplicons.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, genetic alterations in 19 different genes of 12q12-24 were evaluated in 77 lipomatous soft tissue tumors (including lipomas, WDLPS, DDLPS and pleomorphic liposarcomas).\n\nRESULTS: We recorded several amplified genes of 12q13-15, including miR-26a-2, a gene not well studied in liposarcoma, and the well-known and previously described genes murine double minute 2 (MDM2), YEATS domain-containing protein 4 (YEATS4), high-mobility AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and tetraspanin 31 (TSPAN31). Interestingly, the amplification profiles of these six genes were found to be significantly different between WDLPS and DDLPS, more frequently having a high-level status in DDLPS than in WDLPS. In addition, DDLPS were found to have significantly higher mean amplification ratios compared to WDLPS. Moreover, we identified additional genes exclusively amplified in DDLPS in 12q13, 12q21 and 12q24, including glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12 (MAP3K12), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), ALX homeobox 1 (ALX1) and T-box 5 (TBX5).\n\nCONCLUSION: Differences in amplification profiles among WDLPS and DDLPS may be related to progression/de-differentiation in liposarcomas and show how in the future amplification profiles could provide an adjunctive tool in characterizing progression to DDLPS. In addition, we identified additional genes exclusively amplified in DDLPS, which may play a role in liposarcomagenesis, particularly in the de-differentiation process.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8993982', '_score': 459.62335, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Alleles [D000483:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:major]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Microsatellite Repeats [D018895:major]', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization [D009693:minor]', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]'], 'text': 'Complexity of 12q13-22 amplicon in liposarcoma: microsatellite repeat analysis.\n\n\nThe 12q13-22 amplicon from four liposacroma specimens evaluated by comparative genomic hybridization was studied analyzing 55 microsatellite markers by PCR.

These include well differentiated liposarcoma (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS), both characterized by chromosome 12q13-15 amplification. This review will focus on the clinical management of WDLS and DDLS and examine recent molecular studies that have the potential to affect clinical management.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: Outcome of patients with WDLS and DDLS depends on completeness of surgical resection as well as tumor location and histologic subtype. Risk of recurrence is high for patients with dedifferentiated histology or retroperitoneal location. We now understand that surgical outcomes are poor for patients with rapidly growing or incompletely resectable tumors, so these patients should be managed nonoperatively. Radiation and chemotherapy have low response rates in WDLS and DDLS, but novel agents targeted at chromosome 12 gene products MDM2 and CDK4 have shown promise in preclinical studies and are being tested in clinical trials. Cell line, tissue microarray, and genomic analyses have identified additional targets including ZIC1, TOP2A, AURKA, and IGF-1R, which could form the basis of future therapies.\n\nSUMMARY: Although complete surgical resection is currently the most effective treatment for WDLS and DDLS, the majority of patients with retroperitoneal liposarcoma will eventually have recurrence and die of disease. It is hoped that a multimodality approach, which incorporates targeted therapies and complete surgical resection, will significantly improve patient outcomes.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23529275', '_score': 454.2138, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Sensitivity and Specificity [D012680:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'HMGA2 Protein [D025743:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]'], 'text': 'Can HMGI-C be used as an aid with MDM2 and CDK4 to differentiate liposarcoma subtypes from their mimics?\n\n\nPURPOSE: Liposarcoma represents the most common soft tissue tumors in adults. The tumors are characterized by a high morphological diversity and a great variation in biological behavior. Atypical lipomatous tumors represent a distinctive subset of mesenchymal neoplasms featuring mature adipocytic differentiation. Histologically, atypical lipomatous tumor might be easily confused with lipoma. Conversely, dedifferentiated liposarcoma may be confused with other spindle cell/pleomorphic undifferentiated tumors.\n\nMETHODS: A group of liposarcomas was analyzed by investigating the MDM2, CDK4, and HMGI-C proteins. The study was extended to a group of lipomas and non-lipomatous sarcomas, to determine whether the immunohistochemical investigation of these proteins might play any diagnostic role.\n\nRESULTS: Our data suggest that ordinary lipomas may form a molecular genetic and morphological continuum with atypical lipomatous tumor. At one end of the spectrum are lipomas characterized by HMGI-C activation and at the other end are atypical lipomatous tumors with overrepresentation of the HMGI-C, CDK4, or MDM2 proteins. These findings not only provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of lipomatous tumors, but also indicate that the immunohistochemical analysis of HMGI-C, CDK4, or MDM2 may help to increase diagnostic accuracy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: HMGI-C is a useful adjunct in the diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumor and dedifferentiated liposarcoma and differentiates them from their mimics. Therefore, in our experience, HMGI-C expression alone is of rather limited value in the differential diagnosis of liposarcoma subtypes.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '9403703', '_score': 453.94415, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid [D018208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Point Mutation [D017354:minor]', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational [D018807:minor]', 'Retinoblastoma Protein [D016160:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 [D016159:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cyclin D [D056741:minor]', 'Cyclins [D016213:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA Primers [D017931:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Disease Progression [D018450:minor]', 'G1 Phase [D016193:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]'], 'text': 'Molecular aberrations of the G1-S checkpoint in myxoid and round cell liposarcoma.\n\n\nMyxoid and round cell liposarcoma represents a morphological spectrum in which tumor progression from low-grade myxoid to high-grade round cell areas is frequently observed.

The Rb-cyclin D pathway was analyzed by studying the pRb protein, the p16MTS1 gene, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, p27Kip1, cdk4, and cdk6 proteins.

Notably, mdm2 overexpression was seen in 56% of cases and correlated with histological grade, therefore indicating a possible role in tumor progression. Abnormalities involving the Rb-cyclin D pathway were observed in more than 90% of cases. pRb loss was present in one-third of cases and, at variance with that observed in other subsets of sarcoma, overexpression of cyclin Ds represented a rare event.

As a result, nuclear expression of the cytoplasmic transcription factor STAT6 is found in solitary fibrous tumor and serves as a useful diagnostic marker. STAT6 is located in 12q13, a region containing well-characterized oncogenes that are commonly amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma; we have previously reported that STAT6 is expressed in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of STAT6 expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and the underlying genetic mechanism. STAT6 protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a well-characterized series of 35 previously unpublished cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, all with nuclear MDM2 and/or CDK4 expression by immunohistochemistry and/or cytogenetic features of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. FISH for STAT6 was performed in all cases with STAT6 expression, and a subset of control cases without STAT6 expression. In total 4/35 cases (11%) showed STAT6 expression (three with multifocal staining of moderate to strong intensity and one with weak focal staining). FISH demonstrated amplification of STAT6 in all cases positive for STAT6 by immunohistochemistry; in contrast, FISH performed on four STAT6-negative dedifferentiated liposarcomas demonstrated no STAT6 amplification (P=0.0286). Of the four STAT6 amplified cases, three patients were male and one was female, ranging in age from 51 to 76 years. Tumors were located in the mediastinum (n=2), paratesticular soft tissue (n=1), and perirenal soft tissue (n=1). Three patients received pre-operative chemotherapy +/- radiation therapy. In conclusion, STAT6 is amplified in a subset of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, resulting in STAT6 protein expression that can be detected by immunohistochemistry and may be a potential pitfall in the differential diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and solitary fibrous tumor. These findings suggest a role for STAT6-mediated transcriptional activity in some cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma and highlight the genomic complexity and heterogeneity of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25803170', '_score': 447.91522, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Breast Neoplasms [D001943:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]', 'Piperazines [D010879:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Pyridines [D011725:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Retinoblastoma Protein [D016160:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cell Aging [D016922:minor]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA Helicases [D004265:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques [D055785:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]'], 'text': 'MDM2 turnover and expression of ATRX determine the choice between quiescence and senescence in response to CDK4 inhibition.\n\n\nCDK4 inhibitors (CDK4i) earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA last year and are entering phase III clinical trials in several cancers. However, not all tumors respond favorably to these drugs. CDK4 activity is critical for progression through G1 phase and into the mitotic cell cycle. Inhibiting this kinase induces Rb-positive cells to exit the cell cycle into either a quiescent or senescent state. In this report, using well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS) cell lines, we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i-induced senescence. Failure to reduce MDM2 does not prevent CDK4i-induced withdrawal from the cell cycle but the cells remain in a reversible quiescent state. Reducing MDM2 in these cells drives them into the more stable senescent state. CDK4i-induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer, lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53. MDM2 turnover depends on its E3 ligase activity and expression of ATRX. Interestingly, in seven patients the changes in MDM2 expression were correlated with outcome. These insights identify MDM2 and ATRX as new regulators controlling geroconversion, the process by which quiescent cells become senescent, and this insight may be exploited to improve the activity of CDK4i in cancer therapy.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23832711', '_score': 444.94775, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': 'Dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the deep (paralaryngeal) soft tissue: lessons learnt from a case with a partly deceptively benign appearing dedifferentiated component.\n\n\nWe present a case (female, 61 years of age) of dedifferentiated liposarcoma of the deep, cervical (paralaryngeal) soft tissue with a significant myxoid component and characteristic immunohistochemical (strong and diffuse expression of p16, mdm2 and cdk4 in both the well differentiated liposarcomatous and dedifferentiated components) and molecular genetic findings (MDM2-gene amplification on fluorescence in situ hybridization).

These models predict that the observed synergy in reducing cell viability with CDK4 and IGF1R inhibitors depends on the activity of the AKT pathway. Experiments confirmed that combined inhibition of CDK4 and IGF1R cooperatively suppresses the activation of proteins within the AKT pathway. Consistent with these findings, synergistic reductions in cell viability were also found when combining CDK4 inhibition with inhibition of either AKT or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), another receptor similar to IGF1R that activates AKT.

The first one was made up of 92 non-retroperitoneal cases carrying a null p53, mdm2, cdk4 immunophenotype, which remained unchanged over the time of recurrences and along the gamut of histologic subtypes. The second group was represented by five p53+, mdm2-, cdk4- non-retroperitoneal cases, 4 of which were further analysed by PCR-SSCP for p53 mutation. The immunophenotypic profile of these cases, complemented by the molecular findings, supported a role of TP53 in tumor progression in three high-grade MLTs.

MDM2 and CDK4 protein overexpression have also been identified in these tumours.\n\nAIM: To investigate whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MDM2 and CDK4 can be used to diagnose WDLPS and DDLPS.\n\nMETHODS: IHC for MDM2/CDK4 was carried out on a series of 129 paraffin-embedded lipomatous and non-lipomatous soft tissue tumours. The cases were divided into four groups: WDLPS (n = 19), DDLPS (n = 10), benign adipocytic tumours (BAT) (n = 17), and other mesenquimal tumours (OMT) (n = 83). IHC results were compared in each group and the diagnostic efficacy of the test in identifying WDLPS and DDLPS among the other soft tissue tumours was determined. A percentage of tumour cell positivity was evaluated to better characterise the pattern of tumour immunostaining.\n\nRESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of positive MDM2 and CDK4 immunostainings to identify WDLPS among BAT was 100% and 58.8%, and 68.4% and 88.2%, respectively. When distinguishing DDLPS from OMT, sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 and CDK4 were 90% and 65%, and 70% and 96.3%, respectively. The highest specificity was achieved when a case was considered positive with strong and diffuse immunoreactivity in more than 30% of the neoplastic cells (94.1% and 100%, and 77.1% and 98.8%, respectively).\n\nCONCLUSION: Detection of MDM2/CDK4 protein overexpression by IHC can be used by pathologists to diagnose WDLPS and DDLPS.

Most ALTs are characterized cytogenetically by the presence of supernumerary ring and/or long marker chromosomes derived from the chromosomal region 12q13-15. The 12q13-15 chromosome region contains several genes which may play an important role in human tumorigenesis. A series of ALTs was analysed by investigating the MDM2, CDK4, and HMGI-C genes and their proteins. The study was extended to a series of ordinary lipomas, to determine whether the immunohistochemical investigation of these gene products might play any diagnostic role. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the presence of various cytogenetic aberrations involving the 12q13-15 region in 11/18 (61%) lipomas and of ring chromosomes in all ALTs. Overexpression of mdm2 protein was observed in 6/12 (50%) atypical lipomatous tumours. All lipomas were mdm2-negative. cdk4 overexpression was present in 100% of ALTs. Weak cdk4 immunopositivity was detected in 2/18 (11%) ordinary lipomas in a minority of cells. HMGI-C immunopositivity was observed in 10/12 (83%) ALTs. Positive immunoreactivity was also observed in 8/18 (44%) lipomas. Southern blot analysis revealed amplification of the CDK4 and MDM2 genes in 3/5 ALTs analysed. HMGI-C was amplified in 3/5 cases and was deleted in one case. Mutation analysis of the CDK4 gene did not demonstrate any mutation. These data support the hypothesis that ordinary lipomas may form a molecular genetic and morphological continuum with ALT. At one end of the spectrum are lipomas characterized by 12q13-15 rearrangements and HMGI-C activation and at the other end are ALTs with ring chromosomes, 12q13-15 amplification with overrepresentation of the HMGI-C, CDK4 or MDM2 genes, and aberrant cdk4, mdm2, and HMGI-C protein expression. These findings not only provide insights into the molecular pathogenesis of lipomatous tumours, but also indicate that the immunohistochemical analysis of mdm2 and cdk4 may help to increase diagnostic accuracy.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25059573', '_score': 435.20032, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Grading [D060787:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Proportional Hazards Models [D016016:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate [D053208:minor]'], 'text': "Prognostic relevance of Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer grade and MDM2 amplification levels in dedifferentiated liposarcoma: a study of 50 cases.\n\n\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma represents a form of liposarcoma composed of a non-lipogenic sarcoma associated with well-differentiated liposarcoma. The prognostic significance of histological grading of the dedifferentiated component remains to be elucidated due to vague grading criteria employed in previous studies. Molecular markers of tumor behavior, including amplification levels of murine double minute-2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (CDK4) genes, have been explored in a limited number of cases. Here we investigate whether 'Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer' (FNCLCC) grade and MDM2 gene amplification levels have prognostic value in dedifferentiated liposarcoma in terms of local recurrence and disease-specific survival. Fifty cases were retrieved, reviewed and FNCLCC grade was scored for the dedifferentiated component. Testing for MDM2 gene amplification was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Amplification was categorized as high level (≥20 copies) and as low level (<20 copies). Follow-up data was obtained through chart review. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effect of grade and level of MDM2 amplification on outcomes. Our series includes 50 patients (male n=28, female n=22) with an average age of 63 years (range, 28-88) and a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 2-120). Tumors were graded as grade 1 (6%), grade 2 (58%), and grade 3 (36%). When adjusted for age, sex, site, tumor size, and margin status, grade 3 patients had a higher recurrence rate than grades 1 and 2 (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.24, 7.62; P=0.015). Patients with high-level MDM2 amplification had higher recurrence rate on univariate analysis (P=0.028), but not on multivariate analysis (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 0.73, 3.94; P=0.221).

Cases were studied for the presence or absence of t(12;16)(q13;p11) or t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocations by the LSI CHOP Breakapart Rearrangement Probe. These probes contain a sequence encompassing the SAS and CDK4 genes. Four or more copies of this sequence were considered to represent amplification of these genes.\n\nRESULTS: Rearrangement of the CHOP gene was seen in all evaluable myxoid liposarcomas. Rearrangements were seen in 1 dedifferentiated liposarcoma but not in normal myometrium or lipomas. Probe signal amplification was seen in all 5 well-differentiated liposarcomas and 1 myxoid liposarcoma.

We present the rare case of an atypical lipomatous tumor (synonym: well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma) in a 14-year-old girl with the differential diagnosis of lipoblastoma which was excluded by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. The tumor presented as a soft tissue mass at the dorsal part of the right thigh measuring up to 18 cm. Microscopically the lesion consisted of atypical adipocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei and additional multivacuolated lipoblasts. Interphase dual-color FISH performed with chromosome 8 centromeric and YAC164H5 (mapping to exons 2-5 of the PLAG1 gene) probes revealed no rearrangement of PLAG1 oncogene or polysomy of chromosome 8. Additional FISH using an MDM2 gene probe and an BAC534N15 probe (containing sequences specific for the CDK4 gene) showed amplification of the CDK4 gene. These findings indicate that this tumor was no lipoblastoma but an atypical lipomatous tumor, which is of clinical relevance. In young individuals the distinction between lipoblastoma and liposarcoma is often impossible by light microscopy alone.

Of 178 mature lipomatous tumors, 86 were classified histologically as lipoma and 92 as atypical lipomatous tumor. Two of the lipomas harboring MDM2 amplification were reclassified as atypical lipomatous tumors. Overall, 13 atypical lipomatous tumors did not reveal MDM2 or CDK4 amplification, although this was reduced to 12 following analysis of multiple slides. Three of these cases revealed very occasional tumor cells harboring high-level MDM2 amplification, two had a dedifferentiated component, and MDM2 amplification was detected when one tumor recurred. The remaining six cases exhibited reactive/inflammatory features and were reclassified as lipomas. The findings indicate that MDM2 amplification is 93.5% sensitive for diagnosing atypical lipomatous tumor. A total of 2 of the 20 dedifferentiated liposarcomas failed to reveal MDM2 amplification. All atypical lipomatous tumors measured >10 cm, two dedifferentiated liposarcoma presented de novo at <10 cm, and ~50% of lipomas measured >10 cm. Spindle cell lipomas, lipoblastomas, hibernomas and pleomorphic liposarcomas did not reveal MDM2 amplification. Of 201 non-lipomatous tumors, eight revealed MDM2 amplification or multiple faint alphoid 12 signals and were reclassified as dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Multiple faint alphoid 12 signals were observed in nine tumors from seven patients, an observation not previously reported on paraffin sections: these included four atypical lipomatous tumors, and three dedifferentiated liposarcomas, one previously diagnosed as a myxofibrosarcoma, all of which also revealed amplification of CDK4, although two lacked MDM2 amplification.

FRS2 is located on chromosome 12q13-15 that is frequently amplified in liposarcomas. The significance of FRS2 and FGFR signaling in high-grade liposarcomas is unknown. Herein, we first comparatively examined the amplification and expression of FRS2 with CDK4 and MDM2 in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Amplification and expression of the three genes were identified in 90% to 100% (9-11 of 11) of DDLS, whereas that of FRS2, CDK4, and MDM2 were observed in 55% (41 of 75), 48% (36 of 75), and 44% (33/75) of clinically diagnosed UHGPS, suggesting that these "UHGPS" may represent DDLS despite lacking histologic evidence of lipoblasts. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated FRS2 protein indicated that the FGFR/FRS2 signaling axis was generally activated in about 75% of FRS2-positive high-grade liposarcomas. Moreover, we found that FRS2 and FGFRs proteins are highly expressed and functional in three high-grade liposarcoma cell lines: FU-DDLS-1, LiSa-2, and SW872. Importantly, the FGFR selective inhibitor NVP-BGJ-398 significantly inhibited the growth of FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cells with a concomitant suppression of FGFR signal transduction. Attenuation of FRS2 protein in FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 cell lines decreased the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and AKT and repressed cell proliferation. These findings indicate that analysis of FRS2 in combination with CDK4 and MDM2 will more accurately characterize pathologic features of high-grade liposarcomas. Activated FGFR/FRS2 signaling may play a functional role in the development of high-grade liposarcomas, therefore, serve as a potential therapeutic target.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24487315', '_score': 415.92548, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Detection of MDM2/CDK4 Amplification in Lipomatous Soft Tissue Tumors From Formalin-fixed, Paraffin-embedded Tissue: Comparison of Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH).\n\n\nIn this study, the detection of MDM2 and CDK4 amplification was evaluated in lipomatous soft tissue tumors using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a PCR-based technique, in comparison with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These 2 techniques were evaluated in a series of 77 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lipomatous tumors (27 benign adipose tumors, 28 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas, 18 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, and 4 pleomorphic liposarcomas). Using MLPA, with a cut-off ratio of >2, 36/71 samples (22 atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas, and 14 dedifferentiated liposarcomas) showed MDM2 and CDK4 amplification. Using FISH as gold standard, MLPA showed a sensitivity of 90% (36/40) and a specificity of 100% (31/31) in detecting amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in lipomatous soft tissue tumors. In case of high-level amplification (MDM2-CDK4/CEP12 ratio >5), concordance was 100%. Four cases of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (4/26, 15%) with a low MDM2 and CDK4 amplification level (MDM2-CDK4/CEP12 ratio ranging between 2 and 2.5) detected by FISH showed no amplification by MLPA, although gain of MDM2 and CDK4 (ratios ranging between 1.6 and 1.9) was seen with MLPA. No amplification was detected in benign lipomatous tumors and pleomorphic liposarcomas. Furthermore, there was a very high concordance between the ratios obtained by FISH and MLPA. In conclusion, MLPA proves to be an appropriate and straightforward technique for screening MDM2/CDK4 amplification in lipomatous tumors, especially when a correct cut-off value and reference samples are chosen, and could be considered a good alternative to FISH to determine MDM2 and CDK4 amplification in liposarcomas. Moreover, because MLPA, as a multiplex technique, allows simultaneous detection of multiple chromosomal changes of interest, it could be in the future a very reliable and fast molecular analysis on paraffin-embedded material to test for other diagnostically, prognostically, or therapeutically relevant genomic mutations in lipomatous tumors.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '16012847', '_score': 414.87534, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction [D020133:minor]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma [D012208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic [D002471:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Dosage [D018628:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Dedifferentiated liposarcoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation.\n\n\nDedifferentiated areas of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) usually show malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)- or fibrosarcoma-like features and lack any histologic signs of specific differentiation.

Overexpression of E2F1, cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 was detected in 50.7%, 24.3%, 92.1%, and 10.5%, respectively. Overexpression of E2F1 was associated with altered expression of Rb protein. Overexpression of cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 showed an association with normal Rb expression. CDK6 expression revealed a positive correlation with the histologic grade of the sarcoma, and p27 expression was inversely correlated with sarcoma grade. These results suggest that alterations of the Rb pathway proteins are common in soft tissue sarcomas and may participate in their tumorigenesis.

Previous studies have shown that low-level gain of the 12q14-15 region, such as trisomy 12 and 12q15-24 duplication, might be sufficient for the development of minimal atypia and formation of WDLPS. Moreover, because some features, such as overexpression of HMGA2, are shared by both lipomas and WDLPS, it has been hypothesized that lipomas and WDLPS may form a genetic and morphological continuum. We report here the results of molecular cytogenetic analysis of 8 lipomas that had unusual chromosomal features resulting in gains of 12q14-15. While 3 cases had simple numerical rearrangements (trisomy 12) or structural rearrangements (unbalanced translocations with 12q gains), 5 cases were particularly intriguing because of peculiar features such as giant chromosomes, supernumerary chromosomes or neocentromeres that usually are the hallmark of WDLPS. Gain of 12q14-15 sequences including extra copies of MDM2 and CDK4 were detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in all analyzed cases but no expression of MDM2 and CDK4 was observed suggesting that these genomic imbalances had no functional consequence. We observed rearrangements of HMGA2 in 5 out 8 cases. Altogether, our results indicate that moderate gains of 12q are not always associated with a malignant phenotype, and that some intermediary forms exist between classical lipomas and classical WDLPS.

They may be hard to distinguish from benign adipose tissue tumors as well as from other types of sarcomas. Well-differentiated liposarcomas and myxoid liposarcomas are the two histological subtypes that have been best characterized at the genetic level. The defining genetic features of well-differentiated liposarcoma cells are supernumerary circular ("ring") and giant linear rod chromosomes. These rings and giant chromosomes contain amplification of the 12q14-15 region, including the MDM2 gene, associated with coamplification of various other chromosomal regions. In addition, they most often lack alpha-satellite centromeric sequences. The detection of MDM2 amplification is a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis between well-differentiated liposarcomas and lipomas. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas usually present with patterns of MDM2 amplification similar to those observed in well-differentiated liposarcomas. In addition, recent CGH-array studies suggest that co-amplification of MDM2 with the 6q23-25 region might be a specific feature. Myxoid and round-cell liposarcomas are characterized by a translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11) that fuses the DDIT3 and FUS genes. A rare variant translocation t(12;22) that fuses DDIT3 with EWS has also been described. The genetics of pleomorphic liposarcoma is still obscure.

When c-Jun is amplified in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, it is interspersed with amplified MDM2 on ring and giant marker chromosomes. MDM2 amplification is one of the earliest events in liposarcoma development, and these results suggest that c-Jun was amplified at a similar time in the evolution of the tumour. In addition, shRNA to c-Jun in c-Jun-amplified liposarcoma cells reduces cell number in vitro and inhibits tumour formation in vivo without an observable effect on the differentiation state of the liposarcoma cells.

Amplification of chromosomal region 12q13-q14, which contains the CDK4 proto-oncogene, was identified in a subset of fusion-positive RMS. Other tumor types with CDK4 amplification or overexpression, including liposarcoma and neuroblastoma, are sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibition, suggesting that CDK4/6-targeted therapies may provide a new treatment strategy in fusion-positive RMS. To evaluate the role of CDK4 in chromosomal region 12q13-14 amplification in fusion-positive RMS and the potential clinical utility of CDK4/6 inhibition in this disease setting, we examined the biological consequences of CDK4 knockdown, CDK4 overexpression, and pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibition in fusion-positive RMS in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of CDK4 abrogated proliferation and transformation of 12q13-14-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS cells via G1-phase cell cycle arrest. This arrest was associated with reduced RB phosphorylation and E2F-responsive gene expression. Significant differences in E2F target expression, however, were not observed in RMS cells overexpressing CDK4 or in fusion-positive tumors harboring 12q13-14 amplification relative to control cells or tumors lacking amplification, respectively. Treatment with the small molecule CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011 phenocopied CDK4 knockdown, decreasing viability, RB phosphorylation, and E2F-responsive gene expression and inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest. All fusion-positive RMS cell lines showed sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition, with evidence of differential antitumor activity resulting from an inverse relationship between CDK4 expression and inhibitor vulnerability. This variable responsiveness to LEE011 was recapitulated in xenograft models of CDK4-amplified and non-amplified fusion-positive RMS. Our findings demonstrate that CDK4 is necessary for RB-E2F-mediated G1-phase cell cycle progression, proliferation, and transformation in fusion-positive RMS regardless of CDK4 amplification status. Our studies further indicate that single-agent LEE011 is active in the setting of fusion-positive RMS and suggest that CDK4 amplification may be a marker of reduced sensitivity whereas low CDK4 expression may be associated with higher susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibition. Collectively, our data provide preclinical evidence supporting further investigation of CDK4/6-targeted therapies in treatment regimens for fusion-positive RMS.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '21790860', '_score': 380.24985, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Interleukin-6 [D015850:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Leukocytosis [D007964:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Lung Neoplasms [D008175:minor]/secondary [Q000556:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Mice, SCID [D016513:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'RNA, Neoplasm [D012334:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Spectral Karyotyping [D032681:minor]', 'Transplantation, Heterologous [D014183:minor]', 'Cell Culture Techniques [D018929:major]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/transplantation [Q000637:minor]', 'Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor [D016179:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]'], 'text': 'Establishment and characterization of a novel dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line, NDDLS-1.\n\n\nWe established a dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (NDDLS-1) that produces interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF).

Recently, DDLPSs with lipoblastic differentiation, i.e. morphologically lipogenic DDLPSs, were reported. Because of the lipoblastic differentiation, these tumours caused confusion, and were reported under different names. However, cytogenetic and molecular studies have revealed their DDLPS nature. So far, the cases reported have been high-grade pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumours. In this study we have collected another series that contains low-grade tumours, and expand the histological spectrum.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Eighteen cases of DDLPS with lipoblastic differentiation from various anatomical locations were analysed by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and MDM2 fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Two main histological patterns were seen: one featured a spindle cell sarcoma containing lipoblasts with variable nuclear pleomorphism, and the other a pleomorphic liposarcoma-like tumour including the epithelioid variant. Two cases showed low nuclear grade and lipogenic activity in the metastatic foci. CDK4, MDM2 and p16(INK) (4a) overexpression was seen in all except one case. MDM2 amplification was found in all 16 cases tested.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We have expanded the spectrum of this variant of DDLPS to include low-grade tumours, in which a careful search for increased mitotic activity is essential.

ALT/WDLSs and DDLSs are often difficult to distinguish from other tumors with similar morphological characteristics. In this study, we investigated whether the detection of amplified or overexpressed murine double-minute 2 (MDM2) can be a useful diagnostic ancillary aid. We used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect MDM2 amplification and protein overexpression, respectively, in 49 WDLSs, 5 DDLSs, 23 myxoid liposarcomas, 25 benign lipomatous tumors, and 75 spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas. MDM2 amplification was detected in 48 of 49 WDLSs, 5 of 5 DDLSs, 2 of 9 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and 2 of 10 myxofibrosarcomas. We did not detect MDM2 amplification in any of the benign lipomatous tumors. FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification was the most valuable diagnostic aid for ALT/WDLS, as determined by using the Fisher exact test to compare two different diagnoses of 19 biopsies. On the contrary, unequivocal nuclear overexpression of MDM2 was found in only 10 of 50 ALT/WDLSs. The sensitivity and specificity of MDM2 amplification in distinguishing a DDLS from spindle and pleomorphic sarcomas were 100% and 95%, respectively, while those of MDM2 overexpression were 100% and 87%, respectively. In conclusion, our results indicate that FISH-mediated detection of MDM2 amplification is the most useful adjunct in the diagnosis of both ALT/WDLS and DDLS.

It is divided into five groups according to histological pattern: well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic, and dedifferentiated. Dedifferentiated liposarcoma most commonly occurs in the retroperitoneum, while an intraperitoneal location is extremely rare. Only seven cases have been reported in literature. Many pathologists recognize that a large number of intra-abdominal poorly differentiated sarcomas are dedifferentiated liposarcomas. We report a case initially diagnosed as undifferentiated sarcoma that was reclassified as intraperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma showing an amplification of the MDM2 gene.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old woman with abdominal pain and constipation was referred to the Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy, in November 2012. On physical examination, a very large firm mass was palpable in the meso-hypogastrium. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a heterogeneous density mass (measuring 10 × 19 cm) that was contiguous with the mesentery and compressed the third part of the duodenum and jejunum.At laparotomy, a large mass occupying the entire abdomen was found, adhering to the first jejunal loop and involving the mesentery. Surgical removal of the tumor along with a jejunal resection was performed because the first jejunal loop was firmly attached to the tumor.Macroscopic examination showed a solid, whitish, cerebroid, and myxoid mass, with variable hemorrhage and cystic degeneration, measuring 26 × 19 × 5 cm. Microscopic examination revealed two main different morphologic patterns: areas with spindle cells in a myxoid matrix and areas with pleomorphic cells. The case was initially diagnosed as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Histological review showed areas of well-differentiated liposarcoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed and demonstrated an amplification of the MDM2 gene. Definitive diagnosis was intraperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma.No adjuvant therapy was given, but 5 months after laparotomy, the patient presented with a locoregional recurrence and chemotherapy with high-dose ifosfamide was started.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: No guidelines are available for the management of intraperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma. We report this case to permit the collection of a larger number of cases to improve understanding and management of this tumor. Moreover, this study strongly suggests that poorly differentiated sarcomas should prompt extensive sampling to demonstrate a well-differentiated liposarcoma component and, if possible, FISH analysis.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23020289', '_score': 365.3422, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Abdominal Neoplasms [D000008:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid [D018208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Mucins [D009077:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Adipocytes [D017667:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Space [D012187:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Stromal Cells [D017154:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:minor]'], 'text': 'Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas with prominent myxoid stroma: analysis of 56 cases.\n\n\nAIMS: Occasional cases of well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (LPS) contain myxoid stroma, leading to confusion with other sarcomas. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinicopathological and genetic features of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty-six cases of LPS (22 well-differentiated; 34 dedifferentiated) with prominent myxoid stroma were evaluated. Most arose in the retroperitoneum, abdominal cavity, or spermatic cord. The mean size was 170 mm. Myxoid LPS-like plexiform vessels were conspicuous in 11 cases of well-differentiated LPS. In 22 cases of dedifferentiated LPS, myxofibrosarcoma-like curvilinear vessels were prominent. In other cases, the myxoid component had variably bland or pleomorphic morphology. By immunohistochemistry, staining for MDM2 was positive in 95% of cases, and CDK4 in 78%. Cytogenetics in 13 cases showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed amplification of 12q13-15 in six cases evaluated. Of 30 patients with follow-up, all but one had local recurrences (up to four), but only one has so far had distant metastases.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS with prominent myxoid stroma can closely resemble other sarcoma types, especially myxoid LPS and myxofibrosarcoma. The clinical presentation (large retroperitoneal or abdominal tumour) is a clue to the correct diagnosis; the degree of nuclear atypia helps to exclude myxoid LPS.

Heterologous differentiation is seen in 5% to 10% of dedifferentiated LPS, usually with myogenic or osteo/chondrosarcomatous elements. Adipocytic differentiation in the dedifferentiated component is incompatible with the current definition of dedifferentiated LPS. Pleomorphic LPS is a high-grade sarcoma containing lipoblasts. At least in areas, pleomorphic LPS can be indistinguishable from dedifferentiated LPS, except for the presence of lipoblasts in pleomorphic LPS and well-differentiated LPS areas in dedifferentiated LPS. We evaluated 12 unusual liposarcomas: 11 cases with pleomorphic LPS-like morphology affecting patients with concomitant or previous well-differentiated/dedifferentiated LPS, and 1 case resembling inflammatory "MFH" with scattered lipoblasts. Clinical and histologic features were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 was carried out. Amplification of 12q13 to q15 was studied by FISH analysis of the HMGA2 locus. The tumors arose in the retroperitoneum (7), proximal lower extremity (3), chest wall (1), and neck (1) of 9 males and 3 females (median age 66 y; range 49 to 76). Size ranged from 9 to 32 cm (median 23 cm). In 3 cases, there was an abrupt transition between well-differentiated LPS and sheets of pleomorphic lipoblasts, indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. Four cases consisted of otherwise typical dedifferentiated LPS (with adjacent well-differentiated LPS), except for the presence of lipoblasts in the high-grade component. One case contained both nonlipogenic spindle cell areas and an inflammatory "MFH"-like component with numerous admixed lipoblasts. Four cases were composed exclusively of pleomorphic LPS-like areas developing in 1 of the recurrences or metastases of a prior typical dedifferentiated LPS. Two cases also showed heterologous smooth muscle differentiation. MDM2 and CDK4 were positive in both the dedifferentiated LPS and pleomorphic LPS-like components in 12/12 and 11/12 cases, respectively. FISH analysis showed high-level amplification of 12q14.3 in all 8 cases successfully tested. Karyotypes were available for 3 cases and showed ring and giant marker chromosomes. Follow-up, available for 11 patients, ranged from 19 to 196 months (median 36 mo). Seven patients developed local recurrences (multiple in 3), and 3 developed lung metastases. Thus far, 5 patients have died of disease, 3 are alive with recurrent or metastatic disease, and 3 are alive with no evidence of disease. We conclude that dedifferentiated LPS can show lipoblastic differentiation in the high-grade component, resulting in areas indistinguishable from pleomorphic LPS. The available clinical and molecular data support the notion of "homologous" lipoblastic differentiation in dedifferentiated LPS, rather than mixed-type LPS.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20697254', '_score': 363.86322, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary [D009378:major]', 'Osteosarcoma [D012516:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Bone Neoplasms [D001859:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques [D007124:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Well-differentiated liposarcoma with low-grade osteosarcomatous component: an underrecognized variant.\n\n\nMature bone formation in well-differentiated liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma has been described as a reactive or "metaplastic" change in most reports, and its neoplastic nature has not been widely appreciated. We herein describe 9 cases of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma with distinct areas of fibroosseous tissue histologically indistinguishable from low-grade osteosarcomas, that is, parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. The tumors affected middle-aged to elderly patients, and occurred in the retroperitoneum and deep soft tissue of the extremities without connection to the skeletal system. Grossly, all the tumors showed biphasic appearance with lipogenic and osteogenic area, the latter representing 5% to 50% of the total tumor volume. Histologically, the lipogenic component exhibited typical histology of well-differentiated liposarcoma, whereas the osteogenic area consisted of fibroosseous tissue with numerous mature neoplastic bone trabeculae largely lacking osteoblastic rimming, with intervening fascicles of spindle cell proliferation showing low nuclear grade. All samples were positive for MDM2 and/or CDK4 on immunohistochemical analysis; the antibodies stained many osteocytes, indicating that the bone is neoplastic rather than reactive. Three cases showed high-grade osteosarcomatous transformation juxtaposed to the low-grade osteosarcomatous component, reminiscent of the "dedifferentiation" phenomenon of skeletal low-grade osteosarcoma. Follow-up revealed local recurrence in 4 cases, but no distant metastases were documented. Recognition of this earlier underappreciated subtype of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma is important, because the fibroosseous component may seem so bland that it may be confused with benign metaplasia such as myositis ossificans, or conversely, the lipomatous component may be inconspicuous that it may be dismissed as normal fat, and such misinterpretation may potentially result in suboptimal treatment.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '17895758', '_score': 362.84274, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques [D021141:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma [D012208:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques [D007124:minor]'], 'text': 'Dedifferentiated liposarcomas with divergent myosarcomatous differentiation developed in the internal trunk: a study of 27 cases and comparison to conventional dedifferentiated liposarcomas and leiomyosarcomas.\n\n\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma (DLPS) is one of the most frequent sarcomas of the retroperitoneum and represents most undifferentiated sarcomas of the internal trunk. In about 5% cases, the dedifferentiated component is an heterologous sarcoma such as leiomyosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma. We reviewed a series of 65 sarcomas with a myogenic differentiation developed in the internal trunk for which initial diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (37), rhabdomyosarcoma (6), malignant mesenchymoma (6), and DLPS (16). Immunostainings for MDM2, CDK4, alpha smooth actin, desmin, caldesmon, myogenin, c-kit, and progesterone receptor were performed. In 48 cases, the amplification status of MDM2 and CDK4 could be evaluated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction on paraffin-embedded tissues extracted DNAs. After review of the cases, final diagnoses were leiomyosarcoma (35), rhabdomyosarcomatous (20) or leiomyosarcomatous (7) DLPS, probable DLPS (2), and malignant mesenchymoma (1). DLPS were bigger tumors (median: 18.2 cm) than leiomyosarcomas (median: 12 cm).

There was no significant difference in overall survival (57% vs. 34%). Outcome of patients with a DLPS with a myosarcomatous component did not differ from conventional DLPS. In conclusion, most sarcomas with a rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation occurring in the internal trunk of adults are DLPS.

This neoplasm has a remarkable tendency to recurrence after surgical excision, rarely to metastasize. Recurrence usually shows a more aggressive behaviour than primitive disease with a higher tendency to penetrate into adjacent organs. The symptomatology often appears late and the first sign is frequently a palpable abdominal mass. Preoperative study involves using CT and MRI. The surgical resection is the only tool able to modify natural history with regard to survival and local recurrence. Prognosis is severe, with a survival of 5 years, variable from 12 to 50% in the different series. A very important prognostic factor is the degree of tumour and radical surgical treatment. From 1990 to 2001, 32 operations for malignant retroperitoneal tumors were performed by our surgical unit in 19 patients; in 7 of them the tumor was a liposarcoma (4 male and 3 female). Total operations for retroperitoneal liposarcoma were 15, in 4 patients a second operation was performed for recurrence, in 3 a third operation and in 1 a fourth.

However, if the lipogenic component is not abundant due to surgical sampling or small biopsy, dedifferentiated liposarcoma can be difficult to distinguish from other poorly different sarcomas. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a nuclear hormone receptor that plays a critical role in adipocyte differentiation. Prior studies have not only demonstrated PPAR-gamma mRNA in various subtypes of liposarcoma but have also shown that adipocyte differentiation can be induced in some liposarcomas by a PPAR-gamma agonist. In the present study, we investigated whether immunostaining for PPAR-gamma can be used to distinguish dedifferentiated liposarcoma from other retroperitoneal sarcomas. We examined a series of 40 dedifferentiated liposarcoma and compared the staining for PPAR-gamma to a series of 24 retroperitoneal sarcomas that lacked lipogenic differentiation. A monoclonal antibody against PPAR-gamma was used to stain formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Specific nuclear immunostaining was present in 37/40 (93%) of the dedifferentiated liposarcoma and 6/24 (25%) of the other sarcomas (two leiomyosarcomas and four undifferentiated sarcomas). Interestingly, immunostaining for CDK4 and/or MDM2 was identified in three of the four PPAR-gamma-positive undifferentiated sarcomas, raising the possibility that these may represent dedifferentiated liposarcoma. This is the first study demonstrating the utility of PPAR-gamma immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma in tissue sections. Although not completely specific, the presence of PPAR-gamma staining, in combination with histologic findings and other markers, can aid in the diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma, particularly on small biopsies that may not sample the well-differentiated component.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22178310', '_score': 356.20178, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/immunology [Q000276:major]', 'Cytokines [D016207:minor]/immunology [Q000276:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunophenotyping [D016130:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/immunology [Q000276:major]', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging [D008279:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/immunology [Q000276:major]'], 'text': 'Parosteal osteoliposarcoma: a new bone tumor (from imaging to immunophenotype).\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: Parosteal osteosarcomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLPS) of soft tissue share several features: they are slowly progressive, locally aggressive tumors, tend to recur locally, and rarely or never metastasizes if not dedifferentiated. Their treatment is wide surgical resection. Microscopically, both are well differentiated tumors, very like their normal tissue counterpart. They share simple karyotypes with supernumerary ring chromosomes or giant marker chromosomes containing amplified 12q sequences including MDM2 and CDK4 genes, with subsequent overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 proteins. We present the case of a parosteal osteoliposarcoma made of closely intermingled components of a low-grade osteosarcoma and a WDLPS.\n\nCASE: In a 34 year-old woman with a slowly growing mass of the arm, imaging revealed a large well-defined heterogeneous parosteal mass of the upper humerus, with two main components: bone at the base and fat at the periphery. Microscopically, these two components were consistent respectively with low grade osteosarcoma and WDLPS. Cells of the two components were labeled with anti-CDK4 antibody. No labeling with anti-MDM2 antibody and no signal detected with MDM2 FISH analysis were likely due overdecalcification. No frozen tumor tissue was available for FISH analysis nor array-CGH.\n\nDISCUSSION: Differential diagnoses of this new entity would be a well-differentiated liposarcoma with a low-grade osteosarcomatous component that originates from the soft tissues, ruled out on imaging, and an ossifying parosteal lipoma, ruled out on immunohistochemistry.\n\nCONCLUSION: This is the first description of a low-grade parosteal sarcoma with two components that morphologically and immunophenotypically demonstrate characteristics of a parosteal osteosarcoma and of a well-differentiated liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8554106', '_score': 356.03766, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Metastasis [D009362:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Extremities [D005121:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/complications [Q000150:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid [D018208:minor]/complications [Q000150:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': 'Myxoid/round cell liposarcoma of the extremities. A clinicopathologic study of 29 cases with particular attention to extent of round cell liposarcoma.\n\n\nRound cell liposarcoma, a high-grade sarcoma, is a poorly differentiated form of myxoid liposarcoma, which is low grade. It is not known, however, how much of a round cell component within an otherwise typical myxoid liposarcoma results in a neoplasm that behaves as a high-grade sarcoma. Twenty-nine cases of myxoid liposarcoma of the extremities with or without a component of round cell liposarcoma were studied to semiquantitate the amount of round cell component needed to adversely affect prognosis. An estimate of the percent of necrosis, round cell liposarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, and transitional areas was obtained for each slide on all cases. Transitional areas were defined as those that displayed an increased cellularity compared with typical myxoid liposarcoma, but in which the cells remained spindled, did not have overlapping nuclear borders, and retained an easily discernible plexiform vascular pattern. The amount of necrosis was subtracted from the total material available for evaluation, and a composite estimate of the percent of round cell, myxoid, and transitional areas was obtained. Two tumors were located on the upper extremity, 27 on the lower extremity; tumor size ranged frm 3 to 30 cm (median, 14 cm). All 29 tumors had a myxoid component, with a range from 12 to 100% (median, 73%). The range of transitional component for all 29 tumors was 0 to 88% (median, 11%). Twenty-one tumors had transitional areas (range, 4-88%). The range of round cell component for all 29 tumors was 0 to 58% (median, 0%). Twelve tumors had round cell areas (range, 1-58%). Seventeen patients are either alive without disease, or died from unrelated causes at 24-202 months (median, 96 months). Twelve patients are either alive with metastases or died of disease at 10 to 180 months (median, 53 months). Patients with > 5% round cell component in their initial tumor had a statistically significant higher rate of metastasis or death due to disease than those with < or = 5% round cell liposarcoma (p = 0.05). In addition, patients with myxoid liposarcoma with transitional areas did not fare worse than those with myxoid liposarcoma alone. In conclusion, we found that a round cell component of > 5% portends a higher risk of metastasis or death from disease. Furthermore, transitional areas alone do not appear to alter the prognosis of myxoid liposarcoma. Thus, only those areas that are unequivocally round cell liposarcoma should be designated as high grade.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20183915', '_score': 355.51935, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion [D015514:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques [D019411:minor]', 'Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4 [D051358:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/classification [Q000145:major]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/therapy [Q000628:minor]'], 'text': 'Added Value of Molecular Biological Analysis in Diagnosis and Clinical Management of Liposarcoma: A 30-Year Single-Institution Experience.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Treatment decisions and prognosis assessment for liposarcoma is based on a classification that depends on morphological and genetic features.

Subsequently, cases were reclassified with implementation of present-day molecular information.

The classical antimitotic treatments are most often inefficient. The establishment of genetically characterized cell lines is therefore crucial for providing in vitro models for novel targeted therapies. We have used spectral karyotyping, fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting and locus-specific probes, and array-comparative genomic hybridization to identify the chromosomal and molecular alterations of a novel cell line established from a recurring sclerosing WDLPS. The karyotype was hypertriploid and showed multiple structural anomalies.

This giant chromosome contained high-level amplification of chromosomal regions 12q13-21 and lacked the alpha-satellite centromeric sequences associated with WDLPS/DDLPS.

Surgical resection with or without chemotherapy appeared to be the most common form of treatment, although radiation therapy was used in some cases and seemed beneficial. Survival information was available for 11 cases; 4 patients died of disease at 7, 9, 12, and 19 months; 1 died of heart failure 2 days after presentation; 1 died of unknown causes 16 months after presentation; and 3 patients were alive without tumor at 5, 16, and 66 months after diagnosis.

Physical examination showed atrophy of the lower extremities bilaterally and decreased motor strength on the left lower extremity. Radiological studies demonstrated an enhancing lesion in the left paraspinal region, suggesting malignancy. The patient underwent local resection of tumour with safety margins. Pathological examination was consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) with positivity for MDM2 and CDK4 markers. No evidence of metastasis was noted on the radiological studies. The final diagnosis was DDLS, high-grade (G3), pT2bN0M0, stage III. After 6 weeks post-tumour resection, the patient experienced recurrence of malignancy.

To the best of our knowledge, only six cases have been reported until now in the literature.

Microscopic finding of the main tumor revealed a well-differentiated liposarcoma, and that of the colonic lesion revealed a dedifferentiated liposarcoma with nuclei of different sizes and shapes and increased spindle cell morphology. The right kidney and ureter were surrounded by tumor cells but were not infiltrated, and there was no lymph node involvement. The diagnosis of retroperitoneal liposarcoma is often difficult because symptoms appear only after the tumor becomes very large. Some retroperitoneal liposarcomas are found on computed tomography by chance. The clinical course of this case was very rare because of the presentation of melena as the first symptom and the detection of an invasive mass in the ascending colon using colonoscopy.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '7520271', '_score': 336.96036, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Genetic Markers [D005819:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Karyotyping [D007621:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:major]', 'Chromosome Banding [D002871:minor]', 'Chromosome Disorders [D025063:major]', 'Chromosome Mapping [D002874:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:major]'], 'text': 'Complex composition and co-amplification of SAS and MDM2 in ring and giant rod marker chromosomes in well-differentiated liposarcoma.\n\n\nExtra abnormal chromosomes (rings and giant rods) containing chromosome 12 sequences are characteristic of well-differentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS).

When the inflammatory infiltrate predominates, the morphological features overlap with various fibroinflammatory disorders including sclerosing mesenteritis and retroperitoneal fibrosis, making the diagnosis difficult.

The MDM2 fluorescence in situ hybridization assay was very specific for inflammatory well-differentiated liposarcoma as 15 of 17 (88%) cases showed MDM2 amplification, whereas none of the cases of sclerosing mesenteritis or idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis showed amplification. Five cases of retroperitoneal fibrosis were noncontributory secondary to autofluorescence, potentially limiting the usefulness of the assay in certain situations such as inappropriate fixation. Increased MDM2 expression and/or MDM2 amplification can be employed to aid discrimination of inflammatory well-differentiated liposarcoma from fibroinflammatory mimics. MDM2 fluorescence in situ hybridization is a very specific method (100%), but less sensitive (88%), whereas MDM2 expression by IHC is very sensitive (100%), but less specific (83%).

We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53-mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53 in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent.

Well differentiated liposarcoma may progress into dedifferentiated liposarcoma with pleomorphic histology. A minority additionally features myogenic, osteo- or chondrosarcomatous heterologous differentiation. Genomic amplification of the Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) locus is characteristic for well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Detection of MDM2 amplification may supplement histopathology and aid to distinguish liposarcoma from other soft tissue neoplasia.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here we present two cases of dedifferentiated liposarcoma with challenging presentation. Case 1 features a myogenic component. As the tumour infiltrated the abdominal muscles and showed immunohistochemical expression of myogenic proteins, rhabdomyosarcoma had to be ruled out. Case 2 has an osteosarcomatous component resembling extraosseous osteosarcoma. The MDM2 status was determined in both cases and helped making the correct diagnosis. Overexpression of MDM2 and co-overexpression of Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 is demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. The underlying MDM2 amplification is shown by fluorescence in situ hybridisation. Since low grade osteosarcoma may also harbour MDM2 amplification it is emphasised that the amplification has to be present in the lipomatous parts of the tumour to distinguish liposarcoma from extraosseous osteosarcoma.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The two cases exemplify challenges in the diagnoses of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

Aiming at the preclinical identification of novel therapeutic options, we here investigate the functional significance of SRC in primary human LS and in LS-derived cell lines. Immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses reveal relevant levels of activated p-(Tyr416)-SRC in LS of the different subtypes with particular activation in MLS and PLS. Dysregulation of the SRC modifiers CSK and PTP1B was excluded as major reason for the activation of the kinase. Consistent siRNA-mediated knockdown of SRC or inhibition by the SRC inhibitor Dasatinib led to decreased proliferation of LS cell lines of the different subtypes, with MLS cells reacting particularly sensitive in MTT assays. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that this effect was due to a significant decrease in mitotic activity and an induction of apoptosis. SRC inhibition by Dasatinib resulted in dephosphorylation of SRC itself, its interacting partners FAK and IGF-IR as well as its downstream target AKT. Consistent with a particular role of SRC in cell motility, Dasatinib reduced the migratory and invasive potential of MLS cells in Boyden chamber and Matrigel chamber assays.

Cytogenetics in these tumors has identified ring and giant chromosomes composed of 12q13-15 amplicons including the MDM2 gene. Identifying MDM2 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization may prove an adjunctive tool in the diagnosis of lipomatous neoplasms. Dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization employing a laboratory-developed BAC label probe cocktail specific for MDM2 (12q15) and a probe for the centromeric region of chromosome 12 (Abbott Molecular, DesPlaines, IL) was performed on formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue including whole sections from atypical lipomatous tumors (n=13), dedifferentiated liposarcomas (n=14), benign lipomatous tumors (n=30), and pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (n=10), and a tissue microarray containing a variety of high-grade sarcomas (n=63). An MDM2/chromosome 12 ratio >or=2.0 was considered amplified, <2.0 nonamplified, and cases displaying >2 signals of both probes and an MDM2 ratio <2.0 polysomic for chromosome 12.

Chromosome 12 polysomy was noted in 89% of spindle cell/pleomorphic lipomas, while all angiolipomas and lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic. MDM2 amplification was observed in 40% of pleomorphic sarcomas and a small subset of high-grade sarcomas (3/63). MDM2/chromosome 12 fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific tool (both 100%) in evaluating low-grade lipomatous neoplasms. The specificity decreases in high-grade sarcomas, as MDM2 amplification was observed in a small portion of pleomorphic sarcomas and high-grade sarcomas other than dedifferentiated liposarcomas.

The spindle cell areas are accompanied by an adipocytic component, which exhibits the morphologic features required for inclusion in the well-differentiated liposarcoma-atypical lipoma group, including definite lipoblasts. Main differential diagnoses include benign lesions such as spindle cell lipoma and diffuse neurofibroma, as well as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and other malignancies such as sclerosing liposarcoma, low-grade myxofibrosarcoma, low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma.

This work revealed massive highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2, a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred. Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2, which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib, that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma. Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein.

The results indicate that the p53 gene is rarely involved in dedifferentiated liposarcoma (7 per cent of cases analysed) and that low percentages of p53 immunopositivity are still compatible with integrity of the p53 gene.

Over the years the major changes in the classification of lipomatous tumors have included the addition of several new variants of lipoma, the use of the term atypical lipoma for well differentiated liposarcoma of the subcutaneous tissue, and recognition of the entity dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Lipomas, the most common lipomatous tumor, account for nearly one-half of all benign lesions. In their typical form they seldom present diagnostic problems for the pathologist. However, lipomas occurring in deep locations (e.g., intramuscular lipoma, perineural lipoma) or those having unusual features (e.g., chondroid lipoma, lipoma with hibernoma, cellular angiolipoma, spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma) may be confused with liposarcoma. Recent cytogenetic studies have reaffirmed the separate nature of many of the variants of lipoma. Solitary lipomas commonly have rearrangements of chromosome 12, a finding not encountered in multiple lipomas or in spindle cell/ pleomorphic lipoma. Liposarcoma is the most common adult soft tissue sarcoma. It seldom arises from subcutaneous tissues or from preexisting lipomas, and is seldom found in children. The hallmark of liposarcoma is the immature fat cell or lipoblast. Diagnostic lipoblasts have an eccentric, hyperchromatic nucleus, which is indented or scalloped by the presence of one or more fat vacuoles. It is important that these cells occur in the appropriate histologic background because similar cells can be seen in a variety of nonlipomatous lesions (e.g., silicone reaction). Failure to apply strict criteria in identifying such cells and in noting the milieu in which they occur can lead to overdiagnosis of liposarcoma. Liposarcomas are divided into several subtypes: well differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic, and dedifferentiated. Liposarcomas can be conceptualized as occurring in two broad groups, myxoid/round cell liposarcoma and well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Myxoid/round cell liposarcomas occur in middle-aged adults primarily as an extremity lesion. Tumors range from pure myxoid (low grade) to pure round cell (high-grade lesions) with some cases having transitional features. Behavior can be related to the amount of round cell areas. A consistent chromosome abnormality t(12;16) characterizes this spectrum of lesions. Well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas, in contrast, occur in late adult life as extremity or retroperitoneal lesions. They consist of mature fat interlaced with atypical hyperchromatic cells and rare lipoblasts. These lesions recur commonly, but they do not metastasize. Their behavior is strongly influenced by location, with retroperitoneal lesions having the worse prognosis. As a long-term complication of the disease, these lesions may progress histologically (dedifferentiate), a phenomenon that confers upon them metastatic potential. Dedifferentiation is largely a time-dependent phenomenon that occurs in sites in which there is a high likelihood for clinical persistence of disease (e.g., the retroperitoneum). Dedifferentiated liposarcomas occur in an age group similar to well differentiated liposarcoma, but are found far more commonly in the retroperitoneum. Most occur as de novo lesions, with only a small percentage occurring as a late complication of well differentiated liposarcoma, as described above. They consist of well differentiated areas associated with nonlipogenic sarcoma usually resembling high-grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma or fibrosarcoma.

Altogether, approximately 50 bona fide liposarcomas have been reported in children and adolescents, most of which have represented myxoid liposarcomas, with a good prognosis. We undertook a retrospective study of 82 liposarcomas occurring in patients below 22 years of age. Clinicopathologic and follow-up information was obtained. Fluorescence in situ hybridization for FUS, EWSR1, CHOP (DDIT3), and MDM2 was performed in 30 cases. The tumors occurred in 28 males and 54 females (5 to 22 y of age) and involved many locations. Fifty-six cases were typical myxoid liposarcomas, including 2 with round cell areas. The tumors were grade 1 (56 cases) and grade 3 (2 cases). Thirty-seven of 38 patients with follow-up are alive without disease and 1 is alive with disease (median 59 mo follow-up duration, range: 8 to 108 mo). Six cases showed myxoid liposarcoma with spindled growth ("spindle cell myxoid liposarcoma"); these arose in 5 females and 1 male (median age 14 y) and involved the thigh in 40% of cases. All were grade 1. Follow-up (4 of 6 patients) showed local recurrences in 2 cases and metastases in 1 case. Twelve tumors consisted of conventional myxoid liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma ("pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma"); these arose in 4 males and 8 females (10 to 22 y of age) and often involved the mediastinum. Tumor grades were 2 (4 cases) and 3 (8 cases). Follow-up (10 patients) showed 7 dead of disease, 1 alive with disease, and 2 disease free. Four atypical lipomatous tumors were seen including 2 with low-grade dedifferentiation. Two local recurrences were seen; all patients are disease free. Two conventional pleomorphic liposarcomas were seen; 1 patient with follow-up is disease free. FUS-CHOP and EWSR1-CHOP rearrangements were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 15/23 and 2/23 conventional myxoid liposarcomas, respectively, and in no other tumors. Amplification for MDM2 was absent in all cases. We conclude that conventional myxoid liposarcoma is by far the most common subtype of liposarcoma in young patients, with an excellent prognosis. Two apparently novel subtypes of liposarcoma, termed pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma and spindle cell myxoid liposarcoma comprise considerable percentages of liposarcomas in this age group and should be distinguished from conventional myxoid liposarcoma and conventional pleomorphic liposarcoma. Pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma and spindle cell myxoid liposarcoma most likely represent high-grade and low-grade variants of myxoid liposarcoma, respectively.

Well-differentiated liposarcoma (n=17) and an assortment of benign lipomatous tumors (n=37), which had concurrent or previous core needle biopsies, and resection specimens were subjected to both MDM2 immunohistochemistry and MDM2 FISH on both whole-tissue sections and corresponding core needle biopsy sections. Percentage tumor cells positive for MDM2 by immunohistochemistry and an MDM2:CEP12 FISH ratio was calculated in each biopsy and resection specimen pair and the results were compared. MDM2 FISH had a higher sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) compared with MDM2 immunohistochemistry (65 and 89%) in core needle biopsies, respectively. In addition, MDM2 immunohistochemistry had a false-positive rate of 11%, compared to 0% with FISH.

Our goal is to bridge this experimental gap by establishing and characterizing an in vitro/in vivo model useful for examining WDLPS/DDLPS molecular pathogenesis and also therapeutic screening and testing. WDLPS/DDLPS cells were isolated from freshly resected human surgical specimens and were phenotypically and molecularly characterized. MDM2 amplification was determined via FISH analysis. Adipogenic differentiation was evaluated using Oil Red O staining and western blotting (WB). Tyrosine kinase receptors' (TKRs) expression in pre-adipocytes, adipocytes, WDLPS, and DDLPS cells was determined via western blot analysis. SCID mouse xenograft growth was assessed after subcutaneous and/or intraperitoneal tumor cell injection. There was enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, survival, and pro-angiogenic capacity in DDLPS cells vs WDLPS cells. DDLPS cells formed tumors in SCID mice whereas WDLPS did not. WDLPS/DDLPS cells, especially those that exhibited baseline PPARγ expression, partially retained terminal adipogenic differentiation capacity. MDM2 amplification was found in all WDLPS/DDLPS cell strains, CDK4 overexpression was observed in LPS cells as compared with normal adipocytes, and enhanced JUN expression and phosphorylation was seen in DDLPS cells as compared with WDLPS cells. The TKRs: MET, AXL, KIT, and IGF-1R were overexpressed in LPS cells vs normal adipocytes and pre-adipocytes. In conclusion, these newly established cellular and xenograft models can facilitate investigation of liposarcomagenesis, dedifferentiation, and tumor progression.

Clinically, the prediction of dedifferentiation for WD is very important from the therapeutic point of view. To identify genes that are predictive of dedifferentiation and to understand the mechanism of dedifferentiation, we investigated clinical information of 50 cases and studied the gene expression profiles of 36 lipomatous tumors using cDNA microarray. The clinical study showed that the dedifferentiation did not always seem to occur in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, from the gene expression study, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of well-differentiated lesions obtained from dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DD) cases that were indistinguishable from WD pathologically showed a clearly distinct gene expression pattern from WD. Using the pattern-matching program, 1687 genes including 487 known genes were identified, which discriminated WD cases from well-differentiated lipomatous lesions obtained from DD cases.

For the characterization of these neoplasms, we studied 8 MLSLCs, 11 ordinary MLSs, 4 WDLSs, and 6 DDLSs. Cytogenetically, MLSLC and ordinary MLS were characterized by t(12;16)(q13;p11) and FUS-DDIT3 fusion gene, whereas WDLS/DDLS lacked the fusion gene but possessed giant marker/ring chromosomes. Both lipoma-like and myxoid components of the same MLSLC exhibited the identical FUS-DDIT3, as confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunohistochemically, MDM2 and CDK4 were positive in WDLS/DDLS but negative in MLSLC and ordinary MLS. PPARγ, C/EBPα, adipophilin, and perilipin were found in each type of LS. Adipophilin was expressed chiefly in tiny fat droplets of immature lipoblasts, whereas perilipin showed a strong positive staining in large fat vacuoles of signet ring and multivacuolated lipoblasts.

MYCN-amplification and 11q-deletion are important, although incomplete, markers of high-risk neuroblastoma. Thus, characterization of additional genomic alterations that can be used as prognostic and/or predictive markers is of clinical importance in order to provide best possible treatment.From genomic profiles generated through high-density SNP microarrays we identified a group of neuroblastomas (14 primary tumors and two cell lines) with regional high grade amplification of one or multiple loci on the long arm of chromosome 12, commonly involving either chromosomal region 12q13-14, 12q15 or both. Amplification of these regions has also been reported in other malignancies such as liposarcoma, glioma and lung cancer. The two different 12q regions contains the potential oncogenic target genes; CKD4 (12q13-14) and MDM2 (12q15), involved in cell cycle progression and p53 regulation respectively. The CDK4 and MDM2 regions were co-amplified in 13/16 neuroblastoma samples while two tumors had CDK4 amplification in absence of MDM2 amplification and one tumor had MDM2 amplification without CDK4 amplification. Exome sequencing was performed for seven of the primary tumors with 12q-amplification. No novel protein altering single nucleotide variant (SNV) were detected within the amplicons with exception of a rare INHBE K222Q mutation in one patient. The exome sequencing also indicated that two tumors had a substantial number of additional rearrangements at subclonal level within the amplified regions, including a break of MDM2 in intron 8 for one of these patients. Interestingly, the majority of the 12q-amplified neuroblastoma was of abdominal origin, some with renal location with initial suspicion of Wilms tumor. Atypical metastatic pattern were also seen in this patient group showing low degree of bone marrow involvement favoring other metastatic sites such as lung, otherwise an uncommon localization in neuroblastoma.The consistent co-amplification of two separate chromosome 12 regions in this subset of neuroblastoma suggests that these regions contain one or more genes with importance in tumor development. Our study indicates that CDK4 appears as main target in this 12q-amplified neuroblastoma subgroup although other genes such as MDM2 and FRS2 also could provide proliferative advantages. The 12q-amplified neuroblastoma exhibit distinct clinical features and can benefit from targeted therapy using a small molecule CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor such as LEE011 (Novartis).\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22543255', '_score': 309.44824, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Vitro Techniques [D066298:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion [D015514:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS [D034702:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction [D060888:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Transcription Factor CHOP [D051742:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]'], 'text': "A real time PCR based approach for the quantitative detection of FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts in human liposarcoma.\n\n\nPURPOSE: Histology still forms the backbone for the diagnosis of the myxoid and round cell subtypes of liposarcoma but the molecular identification of the different transcript variants remains a challenge, due, in part, to the complexity of multiple overlapping exons that they share between them.

Here, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to identify carbon sources taken up by liposarcoma cell lines derived from xenograft tumors in patients. Interestingly, we found that liposarcoma cell lines consume nucleosides from culture media, suggesting nucleoside salvage pathway activity. The nucleoside salvage pathway is dependent on deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and can be imaged in vivo by PET with 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-[18F]fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine (FAC). We found that liposarcoma cell lines and xenograft tumors exhibit dCK activity and dCK-dependent FAC uptake in vitro and in vivo. In addition, liposarcoma cell lines and xenograft tumors are sensitive to treatment with the nucleoside analogue prodrug gemcitabine, and gemcitabine sensitivity is dependent on dCK expression. Elevated dCK activity is evident in 7 of 68 clinical liposarcoma samples analyzed. These data suggest that a subpopulation of liposarcoma patients have tumors with nucleoside salvage pathway activity that can be identified noninvasively using [18F]-FAC-PET and targeted using gemcitabine.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: Patients with high-grade liposarcoma have poor prognoses and often fail to respond to chemotherapy.

The well- and de-differentiated liposarcomas have complex marker chromosomes, consistently including multiple copies of the MDM2 locus. Since amplification seems to be a primary aberration in these tumors, whereas amplification in osteosarcoma generally is a progression marker, the underlying biological mechanisms may be different. We have therefore investigated the molecular response to Nutlin treatment in several liposarcoma cell lines with such markers, as well as a panel of other sarcoma cell lines. We report that Nutlin efficiently stabilized p53 and induced downstream p53 dependent transcription and apoptosis in liposarcoma cells with amplified MDM2 in vitro. Some effect of Nutlin was also observed on cell lines without amplified MDM2 but with wt TP53, but no apoptosis was induced.

In 4 cases, exenteration was deferred, resulting in recurrence of disease in all 4. All cases were exenterated, and 2 cases had local recurrence despite exenteration. Two cases were associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome and other malignancies. Literature review identified 34 other cases of primary orbital liposarcoma, which, partly because of its rarity, is frequently initially misdiagnosed. The most common subtype is myxoid (56.8%); other types are pleomorphic (10.8%) and well differentiated (29.7%). Well-differentiated tumors have the best prognosis.

The commonly accepted classification of liposarcoma includes five basic histological categories: well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcoma. The clinical behaviour of liposarcoma closely reflects its histological appearance, so that to identify the histological subtypes is very important for both prognosis and therapy. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether the histological features of liposarcoma subtypes can be correlated with MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography) findings by retrospectively evaluating nineteen cases of histologically-proved liposarcoma.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The MRI examinations performed over the past eight years on nineteen patients affected by liposarcoma were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent ultrasound and MRI examination; T2 and T1-weighted sequences were available in all cases and fat-saturated sequences in 4 cases; all patients were administered paramagnetic contrast material. CT scans were obtained in twelve patients. All patients had a biopsy, surgical resection and histology.\n\nRESULTS: The study group had 7 well-differentiated, 8 myxoid, 3 pleomorphic and 1 round cell liposarcoma. Well-differentiated liposarcomas had largely lipomatous appearance on both CT and MRI, typically with septa and areas showing high signal intensity on T2w MR images and low signal intensity on T1w images, and slightly hypodense compared to the muscle in CT, representing the sarcomatous areas. Myxoid liposarcomas were mildly heterogeneous with typical high signal intensity on T2w images and isointense to the muscle in T1w images, with lacy or linear septa of fatty tissue in six cases. The pleomorphic and round-cell subtypes demonstrated marked heterogeneity on MR images, with areas of necrosis and heterogeneous contrast enhancement, indistinguishable from other high-grade sarcomas.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Well-differentiated liposarcoma may be distinguished from other types of liposarcoma by its largely lipomatous appearance. Myxoid liposarcoma may be distinguished on the basis of its homogeneous or mildly heterogeneous structure due to the large amounts of the extracellular myxoid material that give it its typical MR appearance. Both well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas, the most common types accounting for about 50% of all liposarcomas, have a more favourable clinical behaviour than the other histological types. Differentiation of these from the other histological types of liposarcoma therefore has a high significance for prognosis and therapeutical approach. On the basis of our experience and of the literature, we believe that diagnostic imaging and in particular the MR examination may lead to a correct diagnosis.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25760901', '_score': 305.05875, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid [D018208:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Postpartum Period [D049590:minor]', 'Transcription Factor CHOP [D051742:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]'], 'text': 'Primary myxoid liposarcoma of the ovary in a postpartum female: a case report and review of literature.\n\n\nA 36-year-old gravida 4, para 2 African-American woman, presented at three months postpartum with a right ovarian mass identified on a lumbar spine MRI as part of a neurology workup for persistent lower back pain.

To determine whether these tumors are well-differentiated liposarcomas devoid of cytologic atypia or lipomas was the major aim of this investigation. We comprehensively and prospectively studied 19 retroperitoneal adipocytic tumors devoid of cytologic atypia at the cytogenetic and molecular genetic levels. Median patient age was 56 years (range: 36 to 78 y). Median tumor size was 21 cm (range: 8 to 46 cm) and the median weight was 1127 g (range: 173 to 2440 g). All tumors were well-circumscribed and showed no cytologic atypia. Standard cytogenetic analysis demonstrated rearrangements of 12q15 in 4 (of 7) cases. None showed ring or giant marker chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization failed to identify amplification of MDM2, carboxypeptidase M(CPM), SAS, CDK4, DDIT3, or HMGA2 in all cases. HMGA2 rearrangement was observed in 8 (of 19) cases (42%) and was more common in larger tumors (P=0.046). HMGA2-LPP fusion was seen in only 1 case. All tumors were completely excised. Follow-up information was available from 10 cases (median, 6 mo; range: 1 to 58 mo). No tumor recurred or metastasized. In contrast, a control group of 20 well-differentiated liposarcomas diagnosed during the same time period (matched per year of diagnosis) showed 4 instances of local recurrence.

SNP array analysis indicated known amplified genes (MDM2, CDK4, HMGA2) and important novel genes (UAP1, MIR557, LAMA4, CPM, IGF2, ERBB3, IGF1R).

Although this process is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, dedifferentiated liposarcomas rarely produces metastases. The case reported here is rather uncommon: A retroperitoneal WDLPS gave lung metastases that were diagnosed as highly malignant osteosarcomas. We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and Southern blot analyses to characterize the copy number changes and genetic aberrations occurring at different stages of the disease. In the primary tumor, the only detectable aberration was amplification of 12q13-q14, which was present only in a fraction of the cells and revealed by FISH analysis. High-level amplification of 12q13-q14, involving CDK4, MDM2, and HMGIC, was seen both in the relapse and the metastases. The second most common change, gain or high-level amplification of 1q22-q24, was detectable by CGH only in the osteogenic metastases, as was loss of the distal 2q. FISH analyses revealed considerable heterogeneity in the samples, and the percentage of cells showing aberrations was significantly higher in the metastatic samples.

The hypothesis tested was if there is a continuum in the development from lipoma to liposarcoma. Lipoma was characterized by a lack of p53 mutation, p53 LOH and p53 protein expression, as well as by mdm2 amplification and mdm2 protein expression. p53 mutation and p53 LOH were found neither in the well-differentiated nor in the dedifferentiated parts of the liposarcoma. In contrast, mdm2 amplification and an increase in mdm2 protein expression were found to be associated with malignancy and dedifferentiation, whereas p53 protein expression was only slightly increased.

The commonest site of presentation was the neck (28%), followed by the larynx (20%) and pharynx (18%). Sixty-two percent of tumors were low grade (well differentiated and myxoid), and 38% were high grade (pleomorphic and round cell). The principal determinant of outcome was histologic grade. Five-year survival by life-table analysis was 67% overall and varied with tumor type as follows: well differentiated 100%, myxoid 73%, pleomorphic 42%, and round cell 0%. Site appears to have had some influence on prognosis. Oral liposarcoma had a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival of 50%, despite the low grade of all tumors; however, the 5-year survival for laryngeal (89%) and head (83%) liposarcoma was considerably better. Tumor size did not affect prognosis. The mainstay of treatment was surgical excision, used alone in 70% of the cases. Radiotherapy was used with other treatments in 25% of the cases. Prognosis was best for patients treated with surgery only (5-year survival, 83%), compared with those receiving surgery plus radiotherapy (5-year survival, 63%), chemotherapy (5-year survival, 33%), and radiotherapy alone (5-year survival, 0%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Liposarcoma rarely involves the head and neck region.

Retroperitoneal/visceral (RP/V) tumors have a poorer prognosis than extremity/trunk (E/T) lesions, and this has been attributed to frequent presentation with tumors of large size and multiorgan involvement that precludes complete resection. The worse prognosis that is associated with RP/V tumors has also been thought to be histopathologically dependent and not necessarily related to anatomic site. The aim of this study was to determine the role of anatomic site and biologic features in prognosis and outcome in patients after complete resection by examining a large cohort of STS patients with a single histopathology, ie, liposarcoma.\n\nMETHODS: All patients who were treated for liposarcoma from July 1, 1982, through July 1, 1998, were included. Univariate analyses were performed using log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates, and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression. The three end points examined were local recurrence (LR), distant recurrence, and disease-specific survival (DSS).\n\nRESULTS: Seven hundred twenty patients with liposarcoma were evaluated, and of these, 460 had completely resected primary or completely resected locally recurrent disease. Breakdown of anatomic site was 65% E/T (n = 301) and 35% RP/V (n = 159). The median follow-up period for patients who underwent complete resection was 42 months (range, 1 to 194 months). We found that RP/V site is a poor prognosticator that is independent of patient sex and age; tumor size, grade, and margin; and recurrent presentation. Sixty-nine percent of patients with RP/V tumors who died had local disease only and no distant metastasis at the time of death.\n\nCONCLUSION: In liposarcoma, tumor location exerts as strong an influence on prognosis as biology. In contrast to extremity liposarcoma, LR without distant metastasis often results in death for patients with RP/V tumors. For these patients, local control accomplished by complete surgical resection +/- adjuvant radiation therapy should impact strongly on DSS.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '12926159', '_score': 299.7222, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Combined Modality Therapy [D003131:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid [D018208:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:major]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]'], 'text': 'Treatment of myxoid liposarcoma by marginal or intralesional resection combined with radiotherapy.\n\n\nLocal recurrence-free survival rate for myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) is related to negative surgical margins.

When a tumor is adjacent to critical structures, wider resection, which can result in amputation, would be selected for local control. While recognizing that marginal or intralesional resection is associated with high risk of recurrence, circumstances occur that lead surgeons to conduct conservative surgery. To determine whether marginal or intralesional resection combined with radiotherapy can achieve local control, 10 cases (12 tumors) were reviewed involving MLS treated with marginal (8 tumors) or intralesional resection (4 tumors) followed by postoperative radiotherapy (50-70 Gy, average 59.2 Gy).

In the present study, we analyzed the SNP309 genotype in blood samples and tumor tissue from 57 patients with bone or soft tissue tumors showing amplification of MDM2. We did not observe any constitutional enrichment of the G allele. More importantly, there was no preferential amplification of the G allele in tumor tissue from TG heterozygotes.

Symptoms included cough, dysphagia, and chest pain. Four patients were asymptomatic and the tumors were discovered incidentally on chest X-rays. Histologically, 10/18 (55%) cases were atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma, one of which harbored a smooth muscle component (lipoleiomyosarcoma); 3/18 (16%) were de-differentiated liposarcoma, one of which also harbored a smooth muscle component; 3/18 (16%) were myxoid/round cell liposarcoma; and 2/18 (11%) were pleomorphic liposarcoma. The cases of well-differentiated liposarcoma were mostly of the sclerosing type; however, five of them also showed prominent myxoid stroma closely resembling myxoid liposarcoma.

Clinicopathologic features of a large series of these tumors were studied. Cases coded as "liposarcoma or lipoma" from 1970 to 2000 were searched for in our files. Inclusion required an OSG location and diagnosis by established soft tissue criteria. Dermal, other soft tissue, and intraosseous liposarcomas were excluded. Clinical and pathologic material was reviewed and follow-up obtained. Eighteen liposarcomas were included: 10 from males and 8 from females. The median patient age was 51 years (range, 30-70 years). Specific anatomic locations included buccal mucosa (n = 7), tongue (n = 4), parotid gland (n = 3), soft tissue overlying the mandible (n = 2), and one each of palate and submandibular gland. The average tumor size was 4.2 cm (range, 1.5 to 6.0 cm). Histologically, most tumors were well differentiated, including one atypical lipoma (n = 10), followed by myxoid (n = 5) and dedifferentiated (n = 3). OSG liposarcomas of all subtypes had increased numbers of lipoblasts. All patients were treated with surgical excision alone. Follow-up on 15 patients (83%) over a mean of 16.5 years (range, 2 to 53 years) revealed that three patients had between one and six local recurrences over periods of 18 months to 6 years. Twelve patients were without recurrence, with a mean follow-up of 12.8 years (range, 2-23 years). No patients, including those with dedifferentiated liposarcoma, had metastases or died of disease. OSG liposarcomas are rare tumors of adults, occurring most commonly in the buccal mucosa, tongue, and then parotid gland. There were no pleomorphic liposarcomas in this series; well-differentiated liposarcoma was the most common subtype, which can locally recur but, even with high-grade dedifferentiation, does not necessarily predict poor outcome. Therefore, OSG liposarcomas have better prognosis than liposarcoma in other soft-tissue locations, perhaps based on smaller size at presentation.

As its behavior in this setting is incompletely characterized, we undertook a study of a series of superficial PLs, defined as those arising or based primarily in the dermis and/or subcutis without involvement of deep structures. In addition, MDM2 gene amplification, a diagnostic signature of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDL/DL), was evaluated to address the recent observation that this gene is amplified within PL-like areas in DL. PLs were obtained from institutional and consultation files (n=29). Cases were evaluated with respect to age, sex, location (dermis, dermis and subcutis, subcutis), size, predominant pattern (pleomorphic spindled or epithelioid), extent of lipogenic differentiation, and tumor necrosis. MDM2 amplification was analyzed using FISH on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material in 26 cases. Patients ranged in age from 5 to 93 years (M:F=1.4:1). Tumors were located on the extremity (n=15), trunk (n=7), and head and neck (n=7) and involved the dermis (n=4), dermis and subcutis (n=10), and subcutis (n=15). Tumor size ranged from 0.8 to 15 cm (median=2 cm). All were mitotically active high-grade sarcomas [FNCLCC grade 2 (n=23) or 3 (n=6)] with either a pleomorphic spindled (n=24) or an epithelioid pattern (n=5) with variable extent of lipogenic differentiation [<25% (n=15), 25% to 50% (n=9), >50% (n=5)]. Necrosis was present in 3 cases. MDM2 gene amplification was present in 3 of 26 cases. Follow-up information in 24 cases (range=1 to 192 mo; median=48 mo; mean=59 mo) revealed local recurrences (4/24) but no metastasis or death from disease. We conclude that cutaneous and subcutaneous PLs, despite their high grade, have a much more favorable outcome compared with their deep-seated counterparts, most likely attributed to their small size and superficial location. The low incidence of MDM2 gene amplification in our series indicates that most superficial PLs are unrelated to WDL/DL.

All underwent MR imaging, assessing lipomatous content, septation, and nodules. The associations between these features and tumor diagnosis based on morphology and the presence or absence of MDM2 amplification were explored. The age of the patient and the size and location of the lesion were also recorded for statistical analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 87 patients, 54 were classified as lipomas and 33 as ALT/WDL. MR identified ALT/WDL with a sensitivity of 90.9 % (CI 74.5-97.6) and a specificity of 37.0 % (CI 24.6-51.3). The positive and negative predictive values were 46.9 % (CI 34.5-59.7) and 86.9 % (CI 65.3-96.6), respectively. The mean age of patients with ALT/WDL was greater (60 years [range 40-83 years]) than those with lipoma (52 years [range 10-79 years]) (p = 0.025). The mean size of ALT/WDL (18.7 cm [range 5-36 cm]) was significantly greater than lipoma (13.9 cm [range 3-32 cm]) (p = 0.003). Features that increased the likelihood of ALT/WDL included: patient age over 60 years, maximal lesion dimension over 10 cm, location in lower limb, and presence of non-fatty areas, by a factor of 2.61-6.25 times.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: ALT/WDL and lipoma have overlapping MR imaging characteristics. The most reliable imaging discriminators of ALT/WDL were size of lesion and lipomatous content, but due to the overlap in the MRI appearances of lipoma and ALT/WDL, discrimination should be based on molecular pathology rather than imaging.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '26509911', '_score': 288.44073, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'p16 Immunohistochemistry is Less Useful Than MDM2 and CDK4 to Distinguish Dedifferentiated Liposarcomas From Other Retroperitoneal Mimics.\n\n\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDL) frequently involves the retroperitoneum. In the absence of a lipogenic component histologically, the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal DDL includes other sarcomas and, if the tumor has visceral involvement, sarcomatoid carcinoma. DDL demonstrates amplification of chromosome subregion 12q13-q15. Detection of the amplification itself, or the resulting overexpression of the MDM2 and CDK4 genes by genetic and immunohistochemical methods, is a useful ancillary test in the diagnosis of DDL. More recently, immunohistochemistry for p16, the product of the CDKN2A gene, was shown to be a useful adjunct in differentiating well-differentiated liposarcoma from benign adipocytic tumors. In the present study, we examined the utility of p16 immunohistochemistry to distinguish DDL (n=44) from other high-grade and low-grade retroperitoneal mimics (n=73). p16 positivity was observed in 43/44 (98%) DDLs, with the majority of these showing strong, diffuse, staining. The rate of p16 positivity in other retroperitoneal tumors was lower (37/73, 51%) and staining was not as consistently diffuse or intense. Furthermore, p16 positivity varied between the control sarcomas based on tumor type as follows: 11/11 leiomyosarcomas, 8/11 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas, 9/39 sarcomatoid carcinomas, 7/7 desmoid tumors, 1/3 endometrial stromal sarcomas, and 1/2 malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that p16 is highly sensitive for retroperitoneal DDL.

They are locally invasive and have a peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. They account for 0.1-0.2% of all solid tumors and 15% of all soft-tissue tumors. Liposarcomas are usually large and occur most frequently in the lower extremities, in the retroperitoneal, perineal and mesenteric region. In the retroperitoneum they grow slowly due to the ability of the abdominal cavity to accommodate these slowly expanding masses. They don't produce symptoms until they are very large and have invaded local tissues. The case of a 61-year old man with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma is reported. The tumor was discovered due to the association of abdominal mass, weight loss and persistent fever. The fever, especially, is present due to a wide tumor necrosis. The diagnosis was suggested by computed tomography. Normally, the interval between start of symptoms and diagnosis is included within three weeks and one year. Surgical complete resection of the mass with splenectomy and local postoperative radiotherapy were performed. The weight of the mass was 8.56 kilograms and the pathological evaluation showed a pleomorphic highly undifferentiated liposarcoma. This histological type normally presents many tumor giant cells, some of which have the features of lipoblasts. The single most important prognostic factor in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas is the histologic grade of the primary lesion. In the last AJCC Staging System the grades are assigned from grade 1 (well differentiated) to grade 3 (poorly differentiated). The present case is grade 3. In the treatment of sarcoma of the retroperitoneum or genitourinary tract, the conventional chemotherapy does not seem effective, while radiotherapy has a little improvement on survival. Local recurrences are frequent, especially in the first three years, often in the absence of distant metastases. When the tumor recurs locally, the best therapy is still to remove the mass. Sometimes, two or more operations may be necessary for the patient. Generally, the prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival of 15-50%. The patient was admitted in our division 4 months after the first operation with poor medical condition.

Well-differentiated liposarcomas were predominantly composed of lipoma-like and sclerosing components. On CT and MRI image, the attenuation and signal intensity of lipoma-like components resembled those of fat, whereas the signal intensity of sclerosing components was similar to those of muscle. Unenhanced CT image of the myxoid subtype showed density resembling that of water. On contrast-enhanced CT image, it showed gradual reticular or sheet-like enhancement.

The tumours were characterized by dense stromal sclerosis containing singly scattered pleomorphic atypical cells with lipoblastic features. The tumours occurred in four women and four men, aged 39-90 years (mean = 63). They were located in the retroperitoneum, thigh, retropubic space, arm and spermatic cord.

High-level amplification of MDM2 at 12q13-15 was observed in 4/7 cases. All cases were negative for the CHOP translocation; in one MDM2+ case, the CHOP gene showed amplification but no translocation.

Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, we investigated the existence of CHOP split signals in various histological areas of PLS including the MLS/RC-like feature and also estimated the distribution of various signals with polyploidy and amplification. Moreover, to detect CHOP fusion transcripts we performed nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Seven PLSs and three MLS/RCs were selected for FISH analysis using the locus-specific indicator CHOP (12q13) dual color, break apart probe (Vysis, USA). The FISH analysis was applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of representative areas in all cases. Six of seven PLS cases showed the CHOP split signal ranging from 0.5% to 3% of counted nuclei, while all cases of MLS/RC exhibited CHOP rearrangement in more than 50% of counted nuclei.

To address the present lack of therapeutic options, we embarked upon a study of microRNA (miRNA) expression alterations associated with liposarcomagenesis with the goal of exploiting differentially expressed miRNAs and the gene products they regulate as potential therapeutic targets. MicroRNA expression was profiled in samples of normal adipose tissue, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma by both deep sequencing of small RNA libraries and hybridization-based Agilent microarrays. The expression profiles discriminated liposarcoma from normal adipose tissue and well differentiated from dedifferentiated disease. We defined over 40 miRNAs that were dysregulated in dedifferentiated liposarcomas in both the sequencing and the microarray analysis. The upregulated miRNAs included two cancer-associated species (miR-21 and miR-26a), and the downregulated miRNAs included two species that were highly abundant in adipose tissue (miR-143 and miR-145). Restoring miR-143 expression in dedifferentiated liposarcoma cells inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased expression of BCL2, topoisomerase 2A, protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1), and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1). The downregulation of PRC1 and its docking partner PLK1 suggests that miR-143 inhibits cytokinesis in these cells. In support of this idea, treatment with a PLK1 inhibitor potently induced G(2)-M growth arrest and apoptosis in liposarcoma cells.

Treatment options in patients with inoperable or metastatic myxoid liposarcoma are relatively poor though being developed and new hope is growing.\n\nRESULTS: Using kinome profiling and subsequent pathway analysis in two cell lines and four primary cultures of myxoid liposarcomas, all of which demonstrated a FUS-DDIT3 fusion gene including one new fusion type, we aimed at identifying new molecular targets for systemic treatment. Protein phosphorylation by activated kinases was verified by Western Blot and cell viability was measured before and after treatment of the myxoid liposarcoma cells with kinase inhibitors. We found kinases associated with the atypical nuclear factor-kappaB and Src pathways to be the most active in myxoid liposarcoma. Inhibition of Src by the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib showed only a mild effect on cell viability of myxoid liposarcoma cells. In contrast, inhibition of the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway, which is regulated by the FUS-DDIT3 fusion product, in myxoid liposarcoma cells using casein kinase 2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) showed a significant decrease in cell viability, decreased phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappaB pathway proteins, and caspase 3 mediated apoptosis. Combination of dasatinib and TBB showed an enhanced effect.\n\nCONCLUSION: Kinases associated with activation of the atypical nuclear factor-kappaB and the Src pathways are the most active in myxoid liposarcoma in vitro and inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB pathway activation by inhibiting casein kinase 2 using TBB, of which the effect is enhanced by Src inhibition using dasatinib, offers new potential therapeutic strategies for myxoid liposarcoma patients with advanced disease.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23511993', '_score': 281.00766, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins [D050556:minor]/analysis [Q000032:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C [D008807:minor]'], 'text': 'Diagnostic utility of aP2/FABP4 expression in soft tissue tumours.\n\n\nAdipocyte P2 (aP2), also known as fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), is a fatty acid-binding protein found in the cytoplasm of cells of adipocyte differentiation.

The selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib inhibits growth and induces senescence in liposarcoma cell lines and xenografts. Our prior phase 2 study demonstrated that treatment with palbociclib (200 mg daily for 14 days every 21 days) resulted in clinical benefit in WD/DDLS but moderate hematologic toxic effects. It is important to understand whether palbociclib at a new dose and schedule-125 mg daily for 21 days every 28 days-results in clinical benefit and manageable toxic effects.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks of patients with WD/DDLS treated with palbociclib (PD0332991).\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this phase 2, nonrandomized, open-label clinical trial conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 60 patients 18 years and older with advanced WD/DDLS and measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 were enrolled from December 2011 to January 2014 and followed to March 2015. Patients received oral palbociclib at 125 mg daily for 21 days in 28-day cycles.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was PFS. Secondary end points included response rate and toxic effects.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 30 patients were enrolled in the initial cohort and 30 more in an expansion cohort. Median (range) age was 61.5 (35-87) years; 31 patients (52%) were male; median (range) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was 0 (0-1). Progression-free survival at 12 weeks was 57.2% (2-sided 95% CI, 42.4%-68.8%), and the median PFS was 17.9 weeks (2-sided 95% CI, 11.9-24.0 weeks). There was 1 complete response. Toxic effects were primarily hematologic and included neutropenia (grade 3, n = 20 [33%]; grade 4, n = 2 [3%]) but no neutropenic fever.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with advanced WD/DDLS, treatment with palbociclib was associated with a favorable PFS and occasional tumor response.

The aim of this study was to compare DNA sequence copy number changes of these subtypes as investigated by comparative genomic hybridization in 36 patients. Comparative genomic hybridization revealed genomic imbalances in tumors of 27 patients (mean 5.6 imbalances per tumor). The most frequent gains were within single regions of 1q, 12q, and 13q. We found a significant correlation of poor overall survival and gain of 13q21 (P=0.0221), 13q22 (P=0.0341), 13q31 (P=0.0410), and 13q32 (P=0.0074). The univariate Cox regression analysis revealed an increased risk of tumor-related death for patients whose liposarcomas possess with gains of 13q21 and 13q32 simultaneously (P=0.010; RR=7.1; 95% CI 1.6-31.7).

We identified in different liposarcoma subtypes characteristic genomic changes: Gains and high-level amplifications of 12q occurred in all 11 investigated well-differentiated liposarcomas, and these changes were often present simultaneously with gains of 1q (mean 5.5 changes). In the two dedifferentiated liposarcomas, gains of 1q in both liposarcomas, and a high-level amplification of 13q were striking. Only eight of the 17 patients with myxoid/round cell liposarcomas showed changes in DNA copy number (mean 3.4 imbalances). In four of these eight cases gains of 13q occurred. The six pleomorphic liposarcomas possessed the most frequent genomic imbalances (mean number 16.3) of all liposarcoma subtypes investigated. These imbalances were in almost all chromosomal regions detected predominantly as over-representations of chromosomes 1, 5p, 13q, and 22q.

Eighty-one percent of tumors fixed with Holland Bouin's fluid (13/16) were analyzable compared with 100% of formalin-fixed tumors (4/4).

There are no systemic therapeutic regimens known to improve survival when complete surgical resection is not feasible, underscoring the need for an improved molecular understanding of LPS to stimulate the development of effective targeted therapies. The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in WDLPS pathogenesis, with the vast majority of human tumors harboring either MDM2 amplifications or p53 mutations. Nutlin-3, a small-molecular antagonist of MDM2, inhibits cell proliferation via blocking the interaction of MDM2-p53 in LPS with wild-type p53. We wonder whether MDM2 overexpression due to amplification or/and mutant p53 still plays a crucial oncogenic role in LPS containing p53 mutation. Herein, we developed isogenic liposarcoma lines in which the parental forms were MDM2 amplification and p53 wild-type, whereas sublines had mutation p53 expression, showed Nutlin-3 resistance. mRNA sequencing and immunoblotting showed that MDM2 and CDK4 were overexpression in the parental lines and sublines, whereas MDM2 and CDK4 expression was low in mesothelioma and GIST cell lines. HDAC inhibitor (HDACi, SAHA and LBH589) treatment resulted in the dephosphorylation and degradation of MDM2 and p53, but little affected CDK4 and JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in LPS with MDM2 amplification, and in a mesothelioma cell line JMN1B with p53 mutation, but not two mesothelioma lines containing normal MDM2 level and wild-type p53. Our findings indicate that regulation of wild-type 53 degradation by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589 had a substantially effect on LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival associated with upregulation of the PTEN and p21, inhibition of cell proliferation marker cyclin A and PCNA expression, induction of G1 or G2 phase arrest; induction of apoptosis showing an increase of caspase 3/7 activity and expression, PARP cleavage, and the sub-G1 apoptotic population. Moreover, we characterize biological functions of MDM2-p53 axis in nutlin-3-sensitive and nutlin-3-resistant LPS, showing MDM2 knockdown in the four LPS lines and p53 knockdown in the three mutant-p53 LPS lines resulted in anti-proliferative effects. Additive effects were obtained through a coordinated attack on MDM2 and p53, as demonstrated by immunoblots, cell viability and cell cycle analyses, showing that MDM2 and p53 knockdown, in LPS cell lines containing the p53 mutation, induced greater cell apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, compared to either intervention alone, which is comparable to the effects seen after HDAC inhibition by SAHA and LBH589. These compelling pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative responses indicate that HDAC inhibition warrants clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic strategy in LPS, including nutlin-3 resistant sublines with the p53 mutation.Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8295392', '_score': 278.92352, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Thoracic Neoplasms [D013899:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Diagnostic Errors [D003951:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms [D008479:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]'], 'text': '[Difficulties and errors in diagnosis of intrathoracic adipose tumors].\n\n\nThe authors treated 9 patients with intrathoracic adipose tumors of rare localization.

We compared the clinical data, histologic data, MDM2 status (immunohistochemistry [IHC], fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]), genomic profile (array comparative genomic hybridization), and follow-up of 19 patients with peripheral UPS with MDM2 amplification and 62 with peripheral conventional DDLPS retrieved from the French sarcoma network (RRePS) and the Conticabase (Connective Tissue Cancer Network database). For a control cohort, we described 153 patients from the Conticabase, with peripheral UPS without expression of MDM2 by IHC. By IHC, tumor cells were positive for MDM2 in 59 conventional DDLPS and in all UPS with MDM2 amplification. FISH analysis and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed amplification of MDM2 in 54 conventional DDLPS and in all UPS with MDM2 amplification.

We used a strategy to identify effective and potential therapeutic kinase inhibitors, irrespective of the activated kinase pathway, using small molecule kinase inhibitor panel. We screened liposarcoma cell lines of different histotypes to a panel of small molecule kinase inhibitors and analyzed using cell proliferation assay. In vitro cell proliferation assay, colony formation, cell cycle analysis, apoptosis assay and western blotting analysis were performed to investigate the effect and mechanism of inhibitor treatment on liposarcoma. Liposarcoma xenograft model system was also employed to investigate anti-tumor in vivo effects of inhibitor treatment. We observed that cell lines demonstrated diverse in vitro drug sensitivity patterns to various kinase inhibitors. Most of the cell lines showed very high sensitivity towards inhibitors targeting proteasome, protein kinase C, Hsp90, PI3K, mTOR and CDKs. Among the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors; Ponatinib, Dasatinib, and Sunitinib are the top most sensitive drugs affecting liposarcoma cells lines’ viability irrespective of subtypes and all these are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat various cancers. We studied multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ponatinib as an effective potential drug molecule in liposarcoma. We demonstrated that ponatinib treatment in liposarcoma cell lines reduced the levels of phosphorylated KIT compared to total KIT protein levels in dose dependent manner. Further, western blotting experiments revealed effect of ponatinib treatment on KIT downstream signalling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2, STAT3, mTOR, P70S6K and RB without affecting their total protein levels. Significant reduction in cell number and colonies with ponatinib treatment implicates anti-neoplastic effects in liposarcoma. Ponatinib treatment causes cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase by regulating CDK4 and cyclinD1 proteins levels. It also induces apoptosis of treated cells by downregulating AKT and ERK signaling pathway leading to dephosphorylation of BAD. Similar growth inhibiting effect of ponatinib was demonstrated in in vivo liposarcoma xenograft model. In vitro drug sensitivity profiling of liposarcoma highlighted Ponatinib, an oral FDA approved drug, as potential therapeutic drug candidate for treatment and management of this deadly tumor.\n\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '217521', '_score': 275.77667, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Fascia [D005205:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/etiology [Q000209:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Inflammation [D007249:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Microscopy, Electron [D008854:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/etiology [Q000209:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:major]'], 'text': 'Myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma: ultrastructural observations.\n\n\nThe ultrastructural findings in 4 cases of the myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) are described.

The cases were divided into 4 groups based on the findings in the initial excision specimen: conventional atypical lipomatous tumor (n=15), cellular atypical lipomatous tumor (n=21), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (n=24), and atypical lipomatous tumor with a pleomorphic liposarcoma-like component (n=1). The term "cellular atypical lipomatous tumor" was applied to atypical lipomatous tumors having areas of increased cellularity that when non-lipogenic lacked the 5 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields (maximal rate) required for a dedifferentiated component and when lipogenic fell short of being truly pleomorphic liposarcoma-like. Myxoid regions within this spectrum sometimes had prominent or even plexiform vascularity, creating a resemblance to myxoid liposarcoma especially when interspersed small fat cells were present. The most important prognostic factor was tumor location, as none of the 12 patients with a subcutaneous or intramuscular neoplasm died of tumor.

Patients with atypical lipomatous tumor (either cellular or conventional) in central body sites had significantly shorter survival if the tumor transformed into dedifferentiated liposarcoma in recurrence, and, conversely, those with central body site dedifferentiated liposarcoma had significantly longer survival if it recurred as atypical lipomatous tumor.

He received radiotherapy and different lines of standard chemotherapy with local progression and lung metastasis. In November 2009, on the basis of a phase II study demonstrating the efficacy of sunitinib in patients with liposarcoma, the patient was treated with sunitinib at 37.5 mg daily in 4-week cycles on a compassionate use basis.

Furthermore, the possible correlation with histological and clinical parameters was studied.\n\nMETHODS: MDM2 amplification was examined by non-radioactive Southern blot hybridization with a human MDM2 cDNA probe. Mutations in the p53 gene were screened by polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. To study loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the tumor-suppressor genes Rb and p53, we used four polymorphic intragenic Rb markers (introns 1, 17, 20, and 25) and two p53 markers (intron 1 and exon 4).\n\nRESULTS: MDM2 amplification was found in 19 of 45 liposarcomas (42.2%). The frequency of LOH in Rb and p53 was nearly identical (22%). In 4 of 9 tumors (44.4%) with LOH, allelic loss was a concurrent event in both genes. Of 45 liposarcomas, 6 (13.3%) showed p53 mutations. Overall, alterations of the p53/MDM2/Rb pathway occurred in 30 of 45 liposarcomas (66.6%). In contrast to myxoid and pleomorphic variants, well-differentiated liposarcomas were characterized by a high frequency of MDM2 amplification, a lack of LOH of Rb and p53, and p53 mutations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Obviously MDM2 amplification and LOH at the Rh and p53 genes do not occur simultaneously in the oncogenesis of liposarcomas, as is the case for MDM2 amplification and p53 gene mutations (with one exception).

However, little is known about the molecular genetic differences between conventional myxoid (MX) components and RC components in this tumour. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible implications of molecular alterations of G1 to S-phase check-point genes, especially in the RC component. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of p53, MDM2, p14 and p16 protein and assessed proliferative activities using MIB-1 in 29 RC components and 81 MX components from 90 cases. Mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of the MDM2 gene, homozygous deletion, methylation status and mutation of the p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF) genes were also investigated, using concordant paraffin-embedded and frozen material. The data were analysed together with clinicopathological factors to assess their prognostic implications in MLS/RCLS. Immunohistochemically, the over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.01366) and the reduced expression of p14 (p < 0.0001) and p16 (p < 0.0001) proteins were significantly more frequently observed in RC components than in MX components. Reduced expression of p14 protein correlated significantly with hypermethylation of the p14(ARF) gene promoter (p = 0.0176) and over-expression of p53 protein (p = 0.00837). By univariate analysis, reduced expression of p14 and p53 missense mutation were found to reduce the rate of survival significantly (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis, including clinicopathological factors, revealed that tumour site (p = 0.0251), the presence of an RC component (p = 0.0113), high MIB-1 labelling index (p = 0.0005) and p53 missense mutation (p = 0.0036) were adverse prognostic factors. In MLS/RCLS, reduction of p14 protein expression and p53 mutation were related to poor prognosis.

This region was spanned by 4 YACs and contained 30 STS on the YAC and radiation hybrid (RH) framework maps, providing an average STS spacing of 160 kb if each YAC is approximately 1.2 Mb in size. To convert a STS-based YAC map to a STS-based contig map of bacterial clones, 22 non-polymorphic STS markers were used as probes to screen the high density gridded arrays of PAC and BAC clones by filter hybridizations, followed by assembly of clones into contigs by marker content. Contigs have been extended and joined by direct end sequencing of appropriate clones, generating new STSs and rescreening the library as necessary. Using these approaches, we have constructed 5 contigs covering the region with the largest single contig being 1.4 Mb and a final size estimation of 3.6 Mb. The map is comprised of 17 YACs, 187 PACs, 160 BACs, and 17 cosmids; onto this, 6 polymorphic, 97 non-polymorphic, 24 ESTs, and 4 gene-based markers are now placed in a unique order, providing an average resolution of approximately 28 kb.

We discuss the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, toxic effects, and clinical response rates.\n\nEVIDENCE REVIEW: On March 1, 2015, we conducted a review of the literature describing the development of palbociclib. We used the PubMed search terms "PD0332991," "palbociclib," and "CDK4/6 inhibitor" to find all published articles of interest, without limitation as to publication date.\n\nFINDINGS: Palbociclib is a potent and specific oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor that has strong preclinical data to support its activity in retinoblastoma protein-expressing tumors. Phase 1 trials have demonstrated safety, and phase 2 trials have shown single-agent activity in mantle-cell lymphoma, breast cancer, liposarcoma, and teratoma with reversible neutropenia as the main toxic effect.

Though rare, poorly differentiated liposarcomas commonly metastasize to lungs and liver, leading to poor prognosis. Prevention of Extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activity has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach to inhibition of cancer progression. A nutrient mixture (NM) containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid, and green tea extract has shown significant anticancer activity against a number of cancer cell lines. We investigated the effect of NM on liposarcoma cell line SW-872 proliferation (MTT assay), MMP secretion (gelatinase zymography), invasion through Matrigel, and apoptosis and morphology (live green caspase kit and H&E). Liposarcoma cell growth was inhibited by 36 and 61% at 500 and 1,000 microg/ml NM. Zymography demonstrated both MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion, with PMA-enhanced MMP-9 activity. NM inhibited both MMPs with virtual total inhibition at 500 microg/ml NM. Invasion through Matrigel was inhibited at 100, 500, and 1,000 microg/ml by 44, 75, and 100%, respectively. Dose-dependent apoptosis of liposarcoma cells was evident with NM challenge, with virtually all cells exposed to 1,000 microg/ml NM in late apoptosis. H&E staining did not demonstrate any changes in morphology at lower concentrations. However, some apoptotic changes were evident at higher concentrations. In conclusion, NM significantly inhibited liposarcoma cell growth, MMP activity, and invasion and induced apoptosis in vitro-important parameters for cancer development, suggesting NM as a potential treatment strategy for liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '2622288', '_score': 271.5874, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/complications [Q000150:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aortic Aneurysm [D001014:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Fever [D005334:minor]/etiology [Q000209:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/complications [Q000150:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': '[Retroperitoneal liposarcoma.

Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses provide complementary tools for differentiating soft tissue tumours. Our objective was to compare imaging criteria of malignancy with a new diagnostic gold standard, namely, pathological analysis combined with cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses. Nineteen patients with a fatty tumour were included. All had computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging examination before any biopsy or surgery. All had histopathological and cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic analyses. The imaging diagnosis of benign or malignant lesions was accurate in 15 cases, with 4 false positives for malignancy.

The purpose of this study was to correlate radiologists' certainty of the diagnosis of liposarcoma on musculoskeletal MRI with pathology results.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2001 and February 2009, 105 patients who radiologically suggested liposarcoma on their MRI reports were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, pathologically confirmed 64 patients (benign, 42; malignant, 22) were included. Two musculoskeletal radiologists reviewed MR reports and classified these into 3 groups according to the degree of certainty of liposarcoma (CL) by consensus: C1, high; C2, undetermined; and C3, low. Classified data were compared with pathology results.\n\nRESULTS: The number of cases in each group was C1, 32; C2, 12; and C3, 20. Group C1 included 17 liposarcomas (53%), 7 lipomas, 4 other sarcomas, 2 hibernomas, 1 abscess, and 1 epidermal cyst. There were 11 lipomas (92%) and one liposarcoma in C2. In C3, all patients had lipomas. Fifteen (47%) of 32 variable benign or malignant tumors were incorrectly diagnosed as liposarcomas.\n\nCONCLUSION: On the diagnosis of liposarcoma, the radiologists' high degree of CL showed high agreement. However, nonadipose tumors were sometimes misdiagnosed as liposarcomas with a high CL.

Next, the associations between Eag1 expression and clinicopathological features of liposarcoma were analyzed. In addition, the effects of Eag1 on liposarcoma cell proliferation and cycle were evaluated by CCK-8, colony formation, xenograft mouse model, and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was detected by Western blot analysis to explain the detailed mechanisms of oncogenic potential of Eag1 in liposarcoma. It was found that Eag1 was aberrantly expressed in over 67% liposarcomas, with a higher frequency than in lipoma, hyperplasia, inflammation, and normal adipose tissues. However, Eag1 expression was not correlated with clinicopathological features of liposarcoma. Eag1 inhibitor imipramine or Eag1-shRNA significantly suppressed the proliferation of liposarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo, accompanying with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase.

Twenty-six of the 51 FNA from lipomas and 34 of the 39 FNA from malignant lipomatous tumors were satisfactory for evaluation.\n\nRESULTS: FNA from 26 cases of lipomas were cellular, with lobulated, fibroadipose tissue.

A cytodiagnosis of liposarcoma could be made in 23 cases (88%), and these could be further subtyped into well-differentiated (4 cases), myxoid (8), pleomorphic (4), round cell (3) and liposarcoma, ?type (4). Only 50% of the well-differentiated liposarcomas, 3 of the 10 pleomorphic liposarcomas and 8 of the 17 myxoid liposarcomas were diagnosed as such on FNA.

Six months after excision of the recurrence, the mass demonstrated accelerated growth, and a lid-sparing exenteration was performed; histologic examination showed a high-grade liposarcoma. The patient remains disease-free at 4 years. The second patient, a 40-year-old male, presented with an 8-year history of proptosis and a right superotemporal orbital mass.

It is a low-grade sarcoma that tends to recur locally after excision but has a favorable prognosis.

Shortening or elongation of telomeric repeat fragment lengths, as measured by using hybridization with a telomere-specific oligonucleotide probe, was correlated with the presence of telomerase activity. The latter was demonstrable in 69% of malignant tumors. Benign tumors can be distinguished from malignant neoplasias on the basis of telomerase activity.

Myxoid/round cell liposarcomas exhibited a higher telomerase activity level than the classical low-grade variants. Telomerase activity was not correlated with age at the time of diagnosis or with sex. In most cases, telomerase-positive tumors showed higher proliferation indices than did neoplasias lacking telomerase.

In this study, we have found that the human liposarcoma cell line, SW872, secretes cholesteryl ester transfer protein at levels substantially higher than observed from other cell lines. The secretion of CETP from this adipose-derived cell was up-regulated by 25-OH cholesterol and by low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of both full length and exon 9-deleted CETP mRNA demonstrated increases in response to LDL and 25-OH cholesterol, providing evidence for regulation at the message level.

An increase in homogeneous density on the left hemithorax, from the apex to basal area, with blurring of the borders of the heart and the diaphragm, was revealed by lung radiography. Thoracic computed tomography revealed a diffuse pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis at the base of the left hemithorax. Cytologic examination of the pleural fluid demonstrated tumoral cells forming papillary structures with complex branching and fine fibrovascular core. The tumor cells were relatively uniform and had vacuolar cytoplasm with hyperchromatic nuclei.

This side effect may be due to pharmacokinetic interactions caused by shared mechanisms of metabolism involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system in the liver. Here, for the first time in literature, we describe the unexpected onset of heavy toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis, after the fourth course of trabectedin in a patient with retroperitoneal liposarcoma who at the same time was taking an alternative herbal medicine suspected of triggering this adverse event.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: This is the case of a 56 year old Caucasian man affected by a relapsed de-differentiated liposarcoma who, after the fourth cycle of second-line chemotherapy with trabectedin, complained of sudden weakness, difficulty walking and diffuse muscle pain necessitating complete bed rest. Upon admission to our ward the patient showed grade (G) 4 pancytopenia and a marked increase in liver lytic enzymes, serum levels of myoglobin, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase. No cardiac or kidney function injuries were present. Based on these clinical and laboratory features, our conclusive diagnosis was of rhabdomyolysis induced by trabectedin.The patient did not report any trauma or muscular overexertion and no co-morbidities were present. He had not received any drugs during treatment with trabectedin, but upon further questioning the patient informed us he had been taking a folk medicine preparation of chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) daily during the last course of trabectedin and in the 2 subsequent weeks.One week after hospitalization and cessation of intake of chokeberry extract, CPK and other markers of myolysis slowly returned to standard range, and the patient noted a progressive recovery of muscle strength.The patient was discharged on day 14 when a blood transfusion and parenteral hydration gradually lowered general toxicity. Progressive mobilization of the patient was obtained as well as a complete normalization of the laboratory findings.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The level of evidence of drug interaction leading to the adverse event observed in our patient was 2 (probable). Thus our case underlines the importance of understanding rare treatment-related toxicities such as trabectedin-induced rhabdomyolysis and the possible role of the drug-drug interactions in the pathogenesis of this rare side effect. Furthermore, this report draws attention to a potential problem of particular concern, that of nutritional supplements and complementary and alternative drug interactions.

In liposarcomas, the amplification was seen exclusively in well-differentiated tumors with high frequency (4/5) but not in other subtypes (0/15).

Our previous study of LPS predicted homeobox protein A5 (HOXA5) as a target of miR-26a-2, and here we explored further the function of HOXA5, and its relationship with miR-26a-2 in DDLPS cells. Compared to normal human adipocytes, all LPS cell lines showed significant downregulation of HOXA5 (p = 0.046), and inhibition of miR-26a-2 using anti-miR-26a-2 substantially upregulated HOXA5 expression in these LPS cells. Interestingly, overexpression of HOXA5 alone induced very strong apoptotic response of LPS cells. HOXA5-induced apoptosis was p53-independent and caspase-dependent. Surprisingly, overexpression of HOXA5 induced nuclear translocation of RELA (p65), which was not associated with the transcriptional activity of RELA. Rather, nucleolar sequestration of RELA was observed.

Only patients with radiologically demonstrable distant metastases were included. Patient, tumor, treatment, and outcome variables were recorded. Available imaging studies and tumor FFPE blocks were assessed.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 40 patients were identified, translating into a DDLPS metastatic rate of 14% (17% for de novo DDLPS and 9% for secondary dedifferentiation). The average patient age was 61 years with a male predilection. The retroperitoneum and lungs were the most common primary and metastatic tumor sites. Any of the 4 described DDLPS morphological subtypes harbored metastatic potential; MFH/UPS-like morphology was the most common. The median time from primary diagnosis to metastasis was 25 months; more than 50% of metastases developed without local failure. The median survival of metastatic patients was 11.5 months; the 5-year DSS was 5.2%. Patients amenable to complete surgical extirpation (n = 14) faired significantly better (P = .001; log rank).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Metastatic spread is an ominous consequence of DDLPS, especially regarding de novo tumors.

Our goal was therefore to expand the understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive liposarcoma and identify therapeutically-susceptible genetic alterations. We studied a cohort of high-grade liposarcomas and benign lipomas across multiple disease sites, as well as two liposarcoma cell lines, using multiplexed mutational analysis. Nucleic acids extracted from diagnostic patient tissue were simultaneously interrogated for 150 common mutations across 15 essential cancer genes using a clinically-validated platform for cancer genotyping. Western blot analysis was implemented to detect activation of downstream pathways. Liposarcoma cell lines were used to determine the effects of PI3K targeted drug treatment with or without chemotherapy. We identified mutations in the PIK3CA gene in 4 of 18 human liposarcoma patients (22%). No PIK3CA mutations were identified in benign lipomas. Western blot analysis confirmed downstream activation of AKT in both PIK3CA mutant and non-mutant liposarcoma samples. PI-103, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, effectively inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT in liposarcoma cell lines and induced apoptosis. Importantly, combination with PI-103 treatment strongly synergized the growth-inhibitory effects of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin and cisplatin in liposarcoma cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is an important cancer mechanism in liposarcoma. Targeting the PI3K/AKT/pathway with small molecule inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy could be exploited as a novel strategy in the treatment of liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_187921-199', '_score': 262.38293, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstracts\nTitle: Phase 2 trial of the novel multi-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sitravatinib in well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\n\nBackground: Well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DD LPS) is a sarcoma subtype of adipocytic origin characterized by amplification of cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and MDM2. WD/DD LPS is resistant to chemotherapy and success with CDK4 inhibitors is limited. We recently characterized the landscape of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and intracellular signaling pathways finding marked heterogeneity by sarcoma subtype [Patwardhan et al. Oncotarget 2016;7(4)]. In WD/DD LPS cell lines, phosphorylated (p) IGF1-R, MET and PDGFRb are strongly expressed. Selective siRNA knockdown of expression of 1 or more of these RTKs inhibited growth of WD/DD LPS cell lines. Sitravatinib (S) is a novel inhibitor of a broad panel of related RTKs. We showed that S abrogates expression of p-RTKs, including IGF1-R, MET and PDGFRb, at low nanomolar concentrations and potently inhibits proliferation of WD/DD LPS cell lines, where anti-proliferative effects of S were superior to other RTK inhibitors including imatinib, crizotinib and pazopanib. S suppressed tumor growth in vivo in WD/DD LPS. A phase 1 trial of S in solid tumors showed clinical activity in WD/DD LPS. Recommended phase 2 dose was 150 mg/day. As there are no approved RTK inhibitors for adipocytic sarcomas, and based on these findings, we initiated a phase 2 trial of S in WD/DD LPS. Methods: This is a single-arm open-label multi-center Simon 2 stage phase II trial of S in 29 patients (pts) with advanced WD/DD LPS who failed 1 prior therapy and show disease progression before enrollment. Pts receive S 150 mg orally daily continuously. Primary endpoint is the progression free rate at 12 weeks (PFR12) versus historical controls. The design has power of 85% to show improvement in PFR12 from 20% (inactive) to 40% (active) with  = 0.10. Secondary endpoints are ORR, PFS and safety. A subset of pts undergo baseline and on-treatment biopsies and reverse phase protein array used to measure changes in expression of p-RTKs and signaling pathway proteins with confirmation by immunoblot.

Previous studies have shown that high histologic grade and incomplete gross resection are the most important prognostic factors for survival in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma and suggest that patients with liposarcoma have a 3-fold higher risk of local recurrence compared with other histologies.\n\nMETHODS: A prospective database was used to identify 177 patients with primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma treated between July 1982 and June 2002. Histology at primary presentation was reviewed by a sarcoma pathologist and subtyped into 4 distinct groups according to strict criteria. The influence of clinicopathological factors on local recurrence, distant recurrence, and disease-specific survival was analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Of 177 patients with primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma operated on for curative intent, 99 (56%) presented with well-differentiated, 65 (37%) with dedifferentiated, 9 (5%) with myxoid, and 4 (2%) with round cell morphology. The tumor burden was determined by the sum of the maximum tumor diameters. The median tumor burden was 26 cm (5-139). Median follow-up time for 92 (52%) surviving patients was 37 (mean, 0.5-192) months. Multivariate analysis showed that dedifferentiated liposarcoma subtype was associated with a 6-fold increased risk of death compared with well-differentiated histology (P < 0.0001). In addition to histologic subtype, incomplete resection (P < 0.0001), contiguous organ resection (excluding nephrectomy; P = 0.05), and age (P = 0.03) were important independent prognostic factors for survival in retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma was associated with an 83% local recurrence rate and 30% distant recurrence rate at 3 years.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The histologic subtype and margin of resection are prognostic for survival in primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma. Dedifferentiated histologic subtype and the need for contiguous organ resection (excluding nephrectomy) was associated with an increase risk of local and distant recurrence. Nephrectomy may be needed to achieve complete resection, but has no measurable influence on disease specific survival.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23502336', '_score': 261.3772, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic [D003602:minor]', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K [D055655:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Stress, Physiological [D013312:minor]/immunology [Q000276:minor]', 'Fever [D005334:minor]/immunology [Q000276:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]', 'HeLa Cells [D006367:minor]', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I [D015395:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Hyperthermia, Induced [D006979:major]', 'Killer Cells, Natural [D007694:minor]/immunology [Q000276:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/immunology [Q000276:major]/therapy [Q000628:major]'], 'text': 'Effect of thermal stress on MICA/B induction in a human liposarcoma cell line.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: A possible mechanism by which hyperthermia enhances tumor immunogenicity is the induction of NKG2D ligands on tumor cells.

Affected patients were three males and four females ranging in age from 28 to 69 years (median, 51 years). Five patients presented with painless proptosis, one patient had painful proptosis, and no details of presenting symptoms are available in one case.

Radiologic impression included hemangioma, lipoma, and an inflammatory process. Lesional size ranged from 2.8 to 4 cm. Five liposarcomas were purely well-differentiated, one was dedifferentiated, and one was pleomorphic in type. The well-differentiated cases comprised the following subtypes: spindle cell (2 cases), adipocytic (2 cases), and combined adipocytic/sclerosing/inflammatory (1 case).

In each case, the following features were noted: tumor site; tumor size; tumor depth; predominant histologic pattern (epithelioid or malignant fibrous histiocytoma [MFH]-like); extent of necrosis (absent, less than 15%, or at least 15%); mitotic counts; treatment and clinical follow-up. Patients were 11 females and 8 males, aged 33-87 years (mean, 64.5 y; median, 70 y). Tumors involved the extremities (13 patients: intramuscular in 10, subcutaneous in 2, depth unknown in 1), retroperitoneum (4 patients), mediastinum (1 patient), and paratesticular region (1 patient). Size ranged from 4.5--31 cm (mean, 11.9 cm; median, 12.0 cm). Predominant pattern was epithelioid in 7 and MFH-like in 12. Necrosis was present in 15 (79%) and was extensive (36 15%) in 14 patients. Mitotic counts ranged from 0.2--3.4/10 high-power fields (mean, 1.4; median, 1.4) by the average-count method and from 1--6/10 high power fields by the highest count method (mean, 2.9; median, 3.0).

Five had recurrences (range, 3--28 mo; mean, 14.4 mo; median, 8 mo), and four of five (80%) with recurrences were dead of disease. Metastases developed in eight patients (range, 4--48 mo; mean, 19.5 mo; median, 11.5 mo), most commonly to the lungs. In conclusion, pleomorphic liposarcoma is a rare tumor of adulthood that occurs most commonly in the deep, soft tissues of the extremities. It behaves as a high-grade sarcoma that frequently metastasizes, most commonly to the lungs. Although this tumor has a wide range of histologic appearances, no clinical or pathologic feature is predictive of a more aggressive clinical course.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22374332', '_score': 260.2275, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Flavonoids [D005419:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoblotting [D015151:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose [D020714:minor]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Mice, SCID [D016513:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Grading [D060787:minor]', 'Nerve Sheath Neoplasms [D018317:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Piperidines [D010880:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Tissue Distribution [D014018:minor]', 'Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/pharmacokinetics [Q000493:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases [D018844:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug [D004305:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical [D004353:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]'], 'text': 'The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol potentiates doxorubicin efficacy in advanced sarcomas: preclinical investigations and results of a phase I dose-escalation clinical trial.\n\n\nPURPOSE: Dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinases are important to the growth of some sarcomas. Flavopiridol is a pan-CDK inhibitor that has been shown to potentiate chemotherapy. As such, we explored the potentiation of doxorubicin by flavopiridol in sarcoma, in vitro and in vivo, and conducted a phase I trial of flavopiridol with doxorubicin in patients with advanced sarcomas.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sarcoma cell lines and xenografts were treated with flavopiridol alone and in combination with doxorubicin. In the phase I study, doxorubicin and flavopiridol were administered on two flavopiridol schedules; a 1-hour bolus and split dosing as a 30-minute bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion.\n\nRESULTS: Preclinically, flavopiridol potentiated doxorubicin. In vivo, doxorubicin administered 1 hour before flavopiridol was more active than doxorubicin alone. Clinically, 31 patients were enrolled on protocol and flavopiridol was escalated to target dose in two schedules (90 mg/m(2) bolus; 50 mg/m(2) bolus + 40 mg/m(2) infusion) both in combination with doxorubicin (60 mg/m(2)). Dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia but no maximum tolerated dose was defined. Flavopiridol pharmacokinetics showed increasing C(max) with increasing dose. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) responses included two partial responses, however, stable disease was seen in 16 patients. Of 12 evaluable patients with progressive well- and dedifferentiated liposarcoma, eight had stable disease greater than 12 weeks.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The sequential combination of doxorubicin followed by flavopiridol is well tolerated on both schedules.

A unique tumor simulating liposarcoma and myxoid chondrosarcoma.\n\n\nWe report 20 cases of a peculiar fatty tumor that occurred in 16 female and four male patients who were 14-70 years old (median, 36 years). Most lesions were situated in the subcutis, superficial muscular fascia, or skeletal muscle of the limbs and limb girdles (15), trunk (3), and the head and neck (2). They were 1.5-11 cm in size (median, 4 cm) and usually described as yellow (13 of 15) and encapsulated (13 of 15). Microscopically they were well circumscribed and consisted of nests, strands, and sheets of eosinophilic and vacuolated cells, which contained glycogen and fat droplets, resembling brown fat cells, lipoblasts and chondroblasts. In all cases there was a variable background of mature adipose tissue associated with a prominent, partially fibrinous to hyalinized myxoid matrix that contained acid mucopolysaccharides usually resistant to hyaluronidase digestion. Several cases had foci of serous atrophy, perivascular fibrosis, and small thrombi; two were focally calcified. The lesions stained for S100 protein (11 of 12), vimentin (10 of 11), and CD68 antigen with KP1 (9 of 11); focal staining for keratin was also seen (4 of 11), but none stained for epithelial membrane antigen or actin or with HMB45. Follow-up in 12 cases (median, 9.5 years) revealed no local recurrences or metastases. Despite its deep location and atypical cellular features, the lesion's nonaggressive behavior suggests it is benign and neither a myxoid liposarcoma nor a myxoid chondrosarcoma, with which it is most frequently confused. The presence of glycogen in vacuolated fat cells is similar to brown fat, and the presence of sulfated stromal mucins supports focal chondroid differentiation.

Treatment of cells with Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP60015 or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide ameliorated this enhanced apoptosis. Bortezomib inhibited MDR1 expression and function more effectively in SW872-S cells than in SW872 cells, indicating that the increased cytotoxicity relies on the degree of proteasome inhibition. Furthermore, the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) 2, which is highly expressed in SW872-S cells, resulted in partial reversal of cell growth inhibition and increase of MDR1 expression in bortezomib-treated SW872-S cells. These results show that bortezomib exhibits preferential cytotoxicity toward SW872-S cells possibly via highly expressed SERCA2-associated MDR1 suppression and suggest that bortezomib may serve as a potent agent for treating advanced liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '6086979', '_score': 259.1634, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adenocarcinoma [D000230:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary [D009378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Stomach Neoplasms [D013274:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell [D002294:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Lung Neoplasms [D008175:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': '[Four case reports of sarcoma combined with carcinoma].\n\n\nWe report 4 cases of double cancer, combined sarcoma and carcinoma.

Recognized histological subtypes include well differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD/DDLS), myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) and pleomorphic liposarcoma. Currently, there are no proper subtype-specific treatments due to the genetic, histological and clinical heterogeneity of the liposarcoma subentities. In the past decade, the rising understanding of the various genetic and molecular aberrations in liposarcoma led to the development of novel alternative therapeutic strategies. One such therapy is the inhibition of the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) which is overexpressed in liposarcomas. In this study, we dissect the functional role of a novel potent Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922 (AUY922) in different cell lines of myxoid (MLS402, MLS1765) and undifferentiated (SW872) liposarcomas. We show that compared with 17-AAG treatment, lower concentrations of AUY922 achieve markedly cytotoxic effects on tumor cell viability. Combination treatment of AUY922 (20 nM) with Doxorubicin (300 nM) yielded a further reduction in cell viability in comparison to Doxorubicin alone. In vivo, we document an inhibition of tumor growth after AUY922 treatment. Further analyses revealed that Hsp90-inhibition induces apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest. In addition, we report striking perturbations of subtype-specific pattern in Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling after AUY922 application. In conclusion, our results provide evidence that Hsp90-inhibition by AUY922 may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy for myxoid liposarcoma patients.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24508653', '_score': 258.50363, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Mice, SCID [D016513:minor]', 'PPAR gamma [D047495:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]', 'Reactive Oxygen Species [D017382:minor]', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction [D060888:minor]', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases [D053498:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Up-Regulation [D015854:minor]', 'Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Proliferation [D049109:minor]', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases [D048049:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/physiopathology [Q000503:minor]'], 'text': 'High expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2b blocks cell differentiation in human liposarcoma cells.\n\n\nAIMS: We have previously reported that elevated expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase 2 (SERCA2) was related to the malignant degree of different types of human liposarcoma.

To investigate further a possible role of the two genes in sarcomas, 24 large and deep-seated lipomas and 74 liposarcomas of various subtypes were analysed for mdm2 and p53 overexpression by immunocytochemistry. Nineteen cases of the same series were also molecularly analysed for both MDM2 gene amplification and TP53 mutations, and a further ten cases for non-random chromosomal abnormalities. In the retroperitoneal well-differentiated-dedifferentiated (WD-DD) group, 15/16 WD and 8/8 DD liposarcomas displayed the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype, consistent with MDM2 gene amplification in the absence of TP53 mutations. In the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, 5/11 WD liposarcomas also retained the mdm2+/p53+ phenotype whereas all DD liposarcomas showed an immunophenotype and, when assessed, a genotype consistent with mutant TP53. Null mdm2 immunophenotype, coupled with evidence of a specific chromosome translocation t(12;16), was constantly observed in both the usual and the cellular subtypes of myxoid liposarcoma, three cases of which also showed TP53 alterations at the genetic or protein level. Neither mdm2 nor p53 overexpression was observed in the lipomas. The results show the existence of three main pathogenetically distinct groups of liposarcoma. The first retroperitoneal WD-DD group, which represents a novel class of tumours within a single histological category of sarcoma, where MDM2-mediated inactivation of p53 could be related to the pathogenetic mechanism. The second is the non-retroperitoneal WD-DD group, where the TP53 mutations appear to correlate with the dedifferentiation process. The third is the myxoid group, which is characterized by its own unique cytogenetic profile and never shows any involvement of TP53 or MDM2 genes.

However, there is little information on the outcome, management and survivability of patients with extremity liposarcoma in Singapore.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective review of all the patients with extremity liposarcoma, diagnosed between 1997 and 2007, was performed. Univariate and multivariate statistics were used on the data to evaluate the clinical presentations, treatment, outcome and survivability of patients seen.\n\nRESULTS: Over a ten-year period, 30 patients were seen for primary liposarcoma of the extremities. Three patients dropped out and 27 were managed and followed-up. Management included surgery and/or radiotherapy. Histological subtypes included 14 (51.9 percent) well-differentiated, five (18.5 percent) myxoid, four (14.8 percent) de-differentiated, and two (7.4 percent) each of round cell and pleomorphic variants. Four patients (14.8 percent) developed local or metastatic recurrent disease. The mean follow-up was 53 months, and the survival rate with primary disease at 53 months was 92.6 percent. The recurrence-free survival for primary disease at 53 months was 85.2 percent.\n\nCONCLUSION: Liposarcoma of the extremities is relatively rare compared to other major soft tissue tumours. It is a highly pleomorphic disease, whose outcome is dependent on the histological subtype.

Tumors ranged from 3 to 30 cm (mean 11.7 cm; median 10 cm). Nineteen were well-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLs) and 10 were dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLs, five with high-grade and five with low-grade dedifferentiation). One was a myxoid/round cell liposarcoma with 70% round cell areas. All patients were treated by radical orchiectomy.

One patient with WDL had two recurrences at 4 and 7 years, and another had six recurrences over a 17-year period. Only one example of DDL recurred, at 30 months; another patient, who refused therapy for 15 years, had a primary tumor 30 cm in diameter, displayed pulmonary metastases 1 month after excision, and died after 14 months. The patient with MRCL had abdominal metastases after 1 year and was alive at 14 months. In summary, paratesticular WDL had a prolonged course with recurrences in more than half the cases, sometimes late. There were no metastases and the overall prognosis was good.

A biochemical study of mdm2-p53 association in 11 tumor samples characterized by the presence of different mdm2 and p53 immunophenotypes was performed. Immunoprecipitation assays using a p53-specific antibody were performed on tumor tissue and surrounding normal tissue; the immunoprecipitated material was then investigated for the presence of p53 (control) and of coimmunoprecipitated mdm2. This biochemical analysis showed that, in mdm2+/p53+/wild-type retroperitoneal liposarcomas, a band corresponded to mdm2 protein in the cellular lysates immunoprecipitated with a p53-directed antibody.

Sunitinib malate is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor active in other solid tumors carrying similar alterations (i.e., imatinib mesylate-refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors). This single-institution phase II study investigated the safety and efficacy of sunitinib malate in three common STS subtypes.

Three lectins were used-peanut (Arachis hypogaea) agglutinin, which binds to terminal Gal(beta 1,3)GalNAc residues; wheat germ (Triticum vulgare) agglutinin (s-WGA, the succinylated form of WGA), which binds to ((1-4)-D-GlcNAc)n and Neu5NAc residues; and jack bean (Concanavalia ensiformis) agglutinin which binds to alpha-D-Man and alpha-D-Glc residues. Histochemical staining was quantitatively measured by means of a cell image processor.\n\nRESULTS: In the case of certain carbohydrate residues, typical lipomas closely resemble atypical lipomas, which in turn closely resemble well-differentiated liposarcomas; typical lipomas differ significantly from well-differentiated liposarcomas.

The combination of radiological imaging techniques and histopathological analysis provides information for diagnosis; however, the pathogenesis is still uncertain.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old male patient presented with a pharyngeal cavity mass, which had been present for 2 years. The clinical syndrome included obstructive sleep apnea symptoms (i.e., respiratory disturbances, excessive daytime somnolence, and headache) and difficulty swallowing. The radiological examination (CT) demonstrated that there was a low-density irregular solid lesion on the posterior wall of the oropharynx and laryngopharynx, which descended to the superior mediastinum and extended to the left parapharyngeal space and sternocleidomastoid muscle. The boundaries of the lesion were clear, and the lesion's density was nonuniform. Several septations inside the lesion were observed. The CT values of the lesion at the epiglottis and the vocal folds were 11 HU and minus 30 HU, respectively. After enhanced scanning, there was no apparent enhancement of the lesion: the surrounding tissue and blood vessels were squeezed and shifted, but the neighboring sclerotin of the cervical vertebrae was not invaded. The mass was removed via a transcervical approach, resulting in a complete amelioration of the patient's symptoms. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells expressed members of the B7 superfamily, including B7-H1, B7-DC and B7-H3. In addition, the expression of TIM-containing molecules, including TIM-3 and TIM-4, was observed.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CT and MRI demonstrated that the mass was a parapharyngeal liposarcoma. Furthermore, carcinoma-associated B7 and TIM-containing molecules were observed in the tissue, indicating that these molecules are most likely active in the pathogenesis of this disease.\n\nVIRTUAL SLIDES: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here: http://www.diagnosticpathology.diagnomx.eu/vs/1907794973876202."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '2092617', '_score': 254.5747, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/therapy [Q000628:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/therapy [Q000628:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Nephrectomy [D009392:major]', 'Radioisotope Teletherapy [D011867:major]', 'Vincristine [D014750:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes [D003037:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Combined Modality Therapy [D003131:minor]', 'Cyclophosphamide [D003520:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Kidney Neoplasms [D007680:minor]/therapy [Q000628:major]'], 'text': '[Leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma: rare tumors of the kidney].\n\n\nSarcoma accounts for 2.8% of all renal tumours.

One might expand this definition of DDL to include low-grade dedifferentiation (LGDD), because tumors with LGDD alone are capable of metastasizing. We studied 20 cases of retroperitoneal WDL with or without LGDD and/or high-grade dedifferentiation (HGDD) to semiquantitate the amount of WDL, LGDD, and HGDD in each case and to correlate the amounts of these components with clinical outcome. For each case, a composite estimate of each of these components was obtained. Thirteen patients (65%) of 20 had an adverse outcome (AO). Within this group, metastatic disease developed in 3 patients, 2 of whom had areas of HGDD (40% and 20%) in their initial excisions, whereas 1 patient had 30% LGDD and 0% HGDD. Of the patients with AOs, 12 (92%) had LGDD areas, 4 (31%) had HGDD areas, and 1 (8%) had pure WDL. Of the seven patients without AOs, three had recurrences, but metastatic disease did not develop in any. All of these seven patients had some element of WDL, five (71%) had LGDD areas, two (29%) had HGDD areas (20% in both cases), and two (29%) had pure WDL. There was no significant difference in clinical outcome between those patients with WDL and those with WDL/LGDD or WDL/LGDD/HGDD. We conclude that recurrences develop in most patients with retroperitoneal WDL and that most of these patients die as a result of local effects of the tumor. Metastases are rare and may occur in patients with tumors with either LGDD, HGDD, or both but do not occur in pure WDL. Neither the amount of LGDD nor HGDD correlates with clinical outcome.

The retinoblastoma protein, encoded by the RB1 gene located at 13q14, is a key regulator of proliferation, development, and differentiation of certain cell types, including adipocytes. In the current study, we investigated the genetic alterations of the RB1 gene, such as mutation (the essential promoter region and the protein-binding pocket domain; exons 20-24) and methylation of the promoter region, in addition to pRB expression and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) status, in two morphologically distinct areas (non-lipogenic dedifferentiated and well-differentiated components) in 27 patients.

Mutational analysis concerns mostly carcinomas and is not comprehensive for soft tissue sarcomas. Among soft tissue sarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and liposarcoma represent the most frequent tumor types. Most of the few identified mutations for soft tissue sarcomas are localized in the core domain of p53. A correlation between p53 positive immunoreactivity, missense mutations, and a poor prognosis is generally assumed. However, the character of p53 mutations and their functional importance for the clinical process is still unknown.\n\nMETHODS: Sixty-two soft tissue sarcoma samples were investigated for the presence of p53 mutations and for p53 immunoreactivity. Exons 4-9 of the p53 gene were amplified from genomic DNA with the polymerase chain reaction. A prescreen for mutations was performed by nonradioactive single strand conformation polymorphism analysis; striking cases were sequenced directly. For an evaluation of the immunohistochemical status, five p53 antibodies were used.\n\nRESULTS: In 10 tumor samples 7 new p53 mutations and one polymorphism were identified. Mutations were detected for five liposarcomas (four patients) and four MFHs (three patients). Of the seven mutations, three were missense point mutations, three were deletions, and one was a complex conversion. All mutations but one were localized in the core domain of p53. Of 62 tumor samples, 56% (14 of 32 liposarcomas and 21 of 30 MFHs) were positive for p53 immunostaining.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The mutations identified in the core domain affect codons that are structurally or functionally involved in DNA binding. A relation between p53 positive immunoreactivity and a poor prognosis, but not with an exclusively high tumor grade, is evident. p53 mutations in soft tissue sarcomas have a similar spectrum to those in carcinomas.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '21282356', '_score': 253.10147, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/enzymology [Q000201:major]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'RNA Interference [D034622:minor]', 'RNA, Small Interfering [D034741:minor]', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand [D053220:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases [D053498:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]', 'Stress, Physiological [D013312:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]', 'Transcription Factor CHOP [D051742:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Apoptosis [D017209:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]', 'Caspase 3 [D053148:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Caspase 8 [D053181:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Survival [D002470:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Curcumin [D003474:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum [D004721:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]/enzymology [Q000201:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Targeting sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²+-ATPase 2 by curcumin induces ER stress-associated apoptosis for treating human liposarcoma.\n\n\nHuman liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma.

Curcumin dose-dependently inhibited the cell survival of human liposarcoma cell line SW872 cells, but did not affect that of human normal adipose-derived cells. Curcumin-mediated ER stress via inhibiting the activity of SERCA2 caused increasing expressions of CHOP and its transcription target death receptor 5 (TRAIL-R2), leading to a caspase-3 and caspase-8 cascade-dependent apoptosis in SW872 cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, 70% of human liposarcoma tissues showed an elevated SERCA2 expression compared with normal adipose tissues.

We postulated that HIV protease inhibitors may represent a novel class of antiliposarcoma agents. SW872, FU-DDLS-1 and LiSa-2 liposarcoma, and HT1080 and 293 nonliposarcoma cell lines were treated with HIV protease inhibitors (nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir and amprenavir), and clonogenic assays were performed. Nelfinavir exhibited the most potent inhibition of clonogenicity, and further assays for proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were performed with nelfinavir. Immunoblots were performed for sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, proapoptotic and cell cycle-related protein expression after nelfinavir treatment. Finally, a sterol regulatory element binding protein-1-inducible SW872 cell line was developed to examine the phenotype resulting from upregulated sterol regulatory element binding protein-1. Nelfinavir selectively inhibited clonogenicity and proliferation, and induced G1 cell cycle block and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SW872 and LiSa-2 cells, whereas it had minimal or no effect on these parameters in FU-DDLS-1 or nonliposarcoma cells. Nelfinavir induced significant sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent fashion in sensitive SW872 and LiSa-2 cells, modestly in HT1080 cells, but not in nelfinavir-insensitive FU-DDLS-1 and 293 cells without inducing adipocytic differentiation. Forced expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 in inducible-SW872 cells led to the induction of proapoptotic and antiproliferative proteins, and consequent reduction of cellular proliferation.

Efforts made to define the molecular basis of liposarcomas lead to the finding that besides the amplifications of CDK4 and MDM2, Aurora Kinase A, also was shown to be overexpressed.

The frequency of distant metastasis is low and the major burden of disease is locoregional. We sought to define the patterns of locoregional disease to help guide surgical decision making.\n\nMETHODS: Data were collected from 247 patients with de novo or recurrent tumors treated at our institution from 1993 to early 2012. The number and location of tumors at both initial presentation and subsequent locoregional recurrence were determined by combined analysis of operative dictations and radiologic imaging.\n\nRESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients had multifocal locoregional disease (two or more tumors) at initial presentation to our institution, including 9 % who had tumors at synchronous remote retroperitoneal sites. The impact of multifocal disease on overall survival was dependent on histologic subtype (WD vs. DD) and disease presentation (de novo vs. recurrence) at the time of resection. Among patients with initial unifocal disease, 57 % progressed to multifocal locoregional disease with subsequent recurrence, including 11 % with new tumors outside of the original resection field. No clinicopathologic or treatment-related variable, including the type or extent of resection, was predictive of either multifocal or 'outside field' progression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Multifocal disease is common in patients with WD/DD retroperitoneal liposarcoma, and tumors can also develop at remote, locoregional sites.

This methodology associates three complementary techniques, namely digital cell image analysis, the discretisation of numerical data and a Decision Tree technique (DT). The first technique relies on the use of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei, a technique which makes possible a quantitative and thus objective description of nuclei with the help of 24 numerical parameters (15 morphonuclear and 9 DNA content- (ploidy level and proliferation activity) related). The second technique transforms each numerical parameter into an ordinal one with a small number of values (2 to 4) so that only the relevant physical significance of the parameters is retained. The Decision Tree technique generates classification rules on the basis of the discretised parameters quoted above. This methodology was applied to 53 human soft tissue tumors which included 26 lipomatous tumors (13 malignant liposarcomas and 13 benign lipomas) and 27 smooth muscle tumors (11 malignant leiomyosarcomas and 16 benign leiomyomas). The results show that a distinction between benign (lipoma) and malignant (liposarcoma) lipomatous tumors can easily be made by means of simple logical rules depending on only four discretised cytological parameters (two ploidy- and two morphonuclear-related). In contrast, no stable or predictive characterisation can be obtained with respect to the difference between leiomyosarcomas and the leiomyomas. Hence, while lipomas and liposarcomas appeared to be two completely distinct biological entities, leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas seem to involve a continuous biological process.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '6256934', '_score': 249.47545, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Fibroblasts [D005347:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:major]', 'Sarcoma, Synovial [D013584:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:major]', 'Fibrosarcoma [D005354:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Hemangiopericytoma [D006393:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Microscopy, Electron [D008854:minor]', 'Neuroblastoma [D009447:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/ultrastructure [Q000648:major]'], 'text': 'Myofibroblasts in soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\nA series of 129 soft tissue sarcomas was examined ultrastructurally to determine in which neoplasms and to what extent myofibroblasts could be demonstrated.

These so-called lipomatous hemangiopericytomas occurred primarily in men (12 men and 4 women) with a mean age of 54 years (range, 33-74 years). All occurred in deep soft tissue and had an average size of 10 cm when first detected. All were characterized by a relatively sharp border and typical histologic features of hemangiopericytomas, including oval to round cells surrounding a sinusoidal and staghorn vasculature often with perivascular hyalinization. Mature fat varied in amount but usually occupied approximately one quarter to three quarters of the area of tumor. Mitotic activity was low, with more than half the cases having no mitotic activity. Five cases showed moderate nuclear atypia. In four cases, the pericytic regions had sclerotic zones. In contrast to liposarcoma, neither lipoblasts nor isolated atypical hyperchromatic cells within mature fat, as are seen in well-differentiated liposarcoma, were present. Immunohistochemistry performed in four cases showed factor XIIIa in tumor cells and an intricate pattern of immunoreactivity around cells for type IV collagen.

Normal fat has scattered CD34+ dendritic cells and small FXIIIa+ dendritic histiocytes among variably S-100+ adipocytes. The CD34 and FXIIIa+ dendritic cells are more numerous near vessels and within fibrovascular septae. In L and IL, CD34 and FXIIIa+ dendritic cells are activated and some adipocytes express CD34. Mesenchymal areas of SCL, PL, ML, and AL and DL are composed of CD34+ dendritic cells with CD34+ but FXIIIa-negative floret cells in PL or atypical cells in AL and DL. FXIIIa+ dendritic cells are numerous in these lesions, comprising 30-40% of cells in SCL and PL, and 50% in ML, AL, and DL. AN have focal CD34+ interstitial cells and plump FXIIIa+ cells that in one case resembled multivacuolated lipoblasts. The myxoid signet ring lipomatous tumor was CD34 negative with few FXIIIa+ cells.

This genetic finding, very similar to that in well-differentiated liposarcomas, strongly suggests that these tumors actually correspond to undifferentiated liposarcomas. It also suggests that the lack of differentiation could be the consequence of amplification of target genes localized in the 1p32 or 6q23 bands. We report here the characterization by array CGH of the 6q23 minimal region of amplification. Our findings demonstrate that amplification and overexpression of ASK1 (MAP3K5), a gene localized in the 6q23 band and encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase of the JNK-MAPK signaling pathway, could inhibit the adipocytic differentiation process of the tumor cells. Treatment of a cell line with specific inhibitors of ASK1 protein resulted in the bypass of the differentiation block and induction of a strong adipocytic differentiation.

However, the mechanisms of invasion and metastasis remain unclear. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) have important roles in tumour invasion, metastasis, and/or poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between TAMs and MLS.\n\nMETHODS: Using 78 primary MLS samples, the association between clinical prognosis and macrophage infiltration was evaluated by immunochemistry. The effects of macrophages on cell growth, cell motility, and invasion of MLS cell lines were investigated in vitro. In addition, clinicopathological factors were analysed to assess their prognostic implications in MLS.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of CD68-positive macrophages were associated with poorer overall survival in MLS samples. Macrophage-conditioned medium enhanced MLS cell motility and invasion by activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), with the key ligand suggested to be heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF).

In previous work we showed that knock-down of c-Jun by RNA interference impaired the in vitro proliferation and in vivo growth of a DDLPS cell line (LP6) with genomic amplification of the c-Jun locus. Here, we used gene expression analysis and functional studies in a broad panel of cell lines to further define the role of c-Jun in DDLPS and other soft tissue sarcomas. We show that c-Jun knock-down impairs transition through the G1 phase of the cell cycle in multiple DDLPS cell lines. We also found that high levels of c-Jun expression are both necessary and sufficient to promote DDLPS cell migration and invasion in vitro. Our data suggest that high levels of c-Jun enhance motility in part by driving the expression of ENPP2/Autotaxin. c-Jun over-expression has minimal effects on in vitro proliferation but substantially enhances the in vivo growth of weakly tumourigenic DDLPS cell lines. Finally, we provide evidence that c-Jun genomic amplification and over-expression may have similar functional consequences in other types of soft tissue sarcoma. Our data suggest a model in which relatively low levels of c-Jun are sufficient for in vitro proliferation, but high levels of c-Jun enhance invasiveness and capacity for in vivo tumour growth. These observations provide an explanation for the selective advantage provided by c-Jun genomic amplification in vivo and suggest that sarcomas with elevated c-Jun levels are likely to have a particularly high malignant potential.

We aimed to study the usefulness of trabectedin in the treatment of patients with myxoid liposarcomas, a subtype of liposarcoma that is associated with specific chromosomal translocations t(12;16)(q13;p11) or t(12;22)(q13;q12) that result in the formation of DDIT3-FUS or DDIT3-EWSR1 fusion proteins.\n\nMETHODS: 51 patients with advanced pretreated myxoid liposarcoma who started treatment with trabectedin between April 4, 2001, and Sept 18, 2006 at five institutions in a compassionate-use programme were analysed retrospectively. Centralised radiological and pathological reviews were done for most patients. Trabectedin was given either as a 24-h continuous infusion or as a 3-h infusion, every 21 days, at 1.1-1.5 mg(2). 558 courses of trabectedin were given in total, with a median of ten courses for each patient (range 1-23). The primary endpoints were response rate and progression-free survival, and the secondary endpoint was overall survival.\n\nFINDINGS: According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), after a median follow-up of 14.0 months (IQR 8.7-20.0), two patients had complete responses (CR) and 24 patients had partial responses (PR); the overall response was 51% (95% CI 36-65). Five patients had early progressive disease. In 17 of the 23 patients who achieved PR or CR as defined by RECIST and who had centralised radiological review, tissue-density changes, consisting of a decrease in tumour density on CT scan or a decrease in contrast enhancement on MRI (or both), preceded tumour shrinkage. Median progression-free survival was 14.0 months (13.1-21.0), and progression-free survival at 6 months was 88% (79-95).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Trabectedin was associated with antitumour activity in this series of patients with myxoid liposarcoma. The noted patterns of tumour response were such that tissue density changes occurred before tumour shrinkage in several patients. In some patients, tissue-density changes only were seen. Long-lasting tumour control was noted in responsive patients. The compassionate-use programme is still ongoing. This analysis has resulted in the initiation of two prospective studies to assess the role of trabectedin in the treatment of patients with myxoid liposarcoma in preoperative and metastatic settings. Furthermore, the selective mechanism of action for trabectedin in this translocation-related sarcoma is being studied.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '15371941', '_score': 241.15533, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/secondary [Q000556:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Staining and Labeling [D013194:minor]', 'Survival Analysis [D016019:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted [D007091:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/secondary [Q000556:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Pleomorphic liposarcoma: clinicopathologic analysis of 57 cases.\n\n\nPleomorphic liposarcoma is an uncommon form of liposarcoma that only recently has been properly characterized.

Our results with alpha-satellite probes and anti-CENPB antibodies confirm the lack of detectable alpha-satellite sequences in the five ALP-WDLPS supernumerary chromosomes, whereas centromeric activity was proved by the detection of kinetochores by using anti-CENPC antibodies. In contrast, the high grade and dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed a different pattern. In 2 cases, amplified chromosome 12 sequences, including amplification of alpha-satellite 12 sequences in 1 case, were present on chromosomes with typical centromeres.

The epithelioid morphology in PL is still underrecognized and may closely simulate other epithelial neoplasms, mainly adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC). No electron microscopic (EM) studies of the epithelioid variant of PL have been previously described, nor have there been studies of its immunoreactivity with A103 or alpha-inhibin. The purpose of this study is to analyze the histological, immunohistochemical, and EM features of epithelioid PL in an attempt to better explore the distinction from their epithelial mimickers, such as ACC. A panel of 5 antibodies was studied, including A103, alpha-inhibin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), AE1/AE3, and Cam 5.2. Out of 22 cases of PLs, 6 cases characterized by the presence of both epithelioid phenotype and pleomorphic lipoblasts were identified from the EM archives. There were 4 females and 2 males, with a mean age of 58 (range, 39-78). Two lesions arose in the thigh and 1 each in the abdominal wall, chest wall, anterior mediastinum, and retroperitoneum, with tumor size ranging from 7 to 17 cm (mean, 13 cm). Histologically, 2 PLs were pure epithelioid, whereas the other 4 had a mixed epithelioid and MFH-like appearance. Immunohistochemically, A103 (4/6), SMA (4/6), and AE1/AE3 (1/6) revealed a various degree of positive reactions. No immunolabeling for alpha-inhibin or Cam5.2 was detected in any case. By EM, the epithelioid areas revealed round or polyhedral cells with lipid droplets of various sizes and number, intimately apposed cell surfaces, occasional junction-like structures (4/6), and micropinocytotic vesicles (4/6). Interestingly, the ribosome-lamellar complexes, once thought to be characteristic of hairy cell leukemia but rarely seen in solid tumors, were noted in one pure epithelioid PL. When compared to the MFH-like area, rough endoplasmic reticula (RER) were less well developed, but mitochondria were more prominent in the epithelioid components. Neither mitochondria with tubulovesicular cristae nor prominent smooth endoplasmic reticula indicative of ACC were seen. Well-formed external lamina was not present. Other features to support a higher level of epithelial differentiation, such as lumen formation, microvilli, and tonofilaments, were not found. In conclusion, focal A103 reactivity in epithelioid undifferentiated tumors should be interpreted with caution before rendering the diagnosis of a primary or metastatic ACC, especially when examining biopsy specimens. The possibility of an epithelioid variant of PL must be excluded; alpha-inhibin can serve as a useful adjunct in this regard. In addition to variable intracytoplasmic fat droplets, the distinctive ultrastructural features of epithelioid variant of PL include numerous mitochondria, pinocytotic vesicles, junction-like structures, and, rarely, ribosome-lamellar complex. Despite some overlapping features, electron microscopy remains a useful tool to distinguish between epithelioid PL and ACC.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '14961574', '_score': 240.43082, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Karyotyping [D007621:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Bone Neoplasms [D001859:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Chromosome Banding [D002871:minor]', 'Chromosome Mapping [D002874:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1 [D002878:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:major]', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:minor]'], 'text': 'Amplification of chromosome 1 sequences in lipomatous tumors and other sarcomas.\n\n\nAmplifications and gains involving 1q are common abnormalities in solid tumors.

The presence, distribution and copy number level of extra COAS sequences were investigated in 48 bone and soft tissue tumor (BSTT) samples using metaphase FISH analysis. Amplification was seen in 27/48 (56%) samples. With few exceptions, all 3 genes were involved, but on average COAS2 exhibited higher copy numbers. The presence of extra COAS signals, irrespective of copy numbers, was found at similar frequencies in different histologic tumor subtypes. However, medium or high level amplification was common in lipomatous tumors but rare in other, nonlipomatous tumors (9/21 vs. 2/27 samples). The most common localization of extra COAS signals in lipomatous tumors was in supernumerary ring and giant marker chromosomes. Among nonlipomatous tumors, the distribution of extra COAS genes was more disperse, being located in various unidentified chromosomal structures, including double minutes, and only rarely in ring chromosomes. Because MDM2 is known to be amplified frequently in BSTTs, and in particular in atypical lipomatous tumors, cases with extra copies of COAS were studied also with an MDM2 probe. Twelve out of 18 lipomatous tumors had extra copies of both COAS and MDM2, and the 2 genes were found to be coamplified and interspersed exclusively in ring and giant marker chromosomes. Also 12 out of 18 nonlipomatous tumors exhibited simultaneous gain of COAS and MDM2, but colocalization in the same chromosome was less frequent. The role of the frequent coamplification of COAS, or some other yet unknown gene in the 1q21-23 region, and MDM2 remains to be elucidated.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '26573603', '_score': 240.27562, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness [D009361:minor]/physiopathology [Q000503:minor]', 'Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases [D020794:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Movement [D002465:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'Cell Proliferation [D049109:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay [D004797:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins [D036341:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]'], 'text': 'AXL is a potential therapeutic target in dedifferentiated and pleomorphic liposarcomas.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: AXL is a well-characterized, protumorigenic receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed and activated in numerous human carcinomas and sarcomas, including aggressive subtypes of liposarcoma.

A panel of DDLPS and PLS cell lines were interrogated via western blot for AXL expression and activity and by ELISA for growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) production.

In addition, AXL shRNA-containing DDLPS cells were assessed for their tumor-forming capacity in vivo.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we determined that AXL is expressed in a subset of WDLPS, DDLPS, and PLS patient tumor samples. In addition, AXL and its ligand GAS6 are expressed in a panel of DDLPS and PLS cell lines.

Herniated orbital fat is thought to be a reactive process, but its presentation can mimic a lipomatous tumour such as an atypical lipomatous tumour or spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma. Genetic studies to determine if it is indeed a reactive process rather than an adipocytic neoplasm have not been performed.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Four samples of herniated orbital fat were reviewed clinically, histopathologically and immunohistochemically. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used to search for genome-wide copy number alterations within the tumours. Histological evaluation revealed that all four tumours contained collections of adipocytes surrounded by fibrous septae. Lochkern cells and floret-like multinucleated giant cells were present, consistent with herniated orbital fat. CD34 was positive in all tumours. Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 was negative. ACGH analysis demonstrated no copy number alterations.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Herniated orbital fat may share some histopathological features with lipoma and atypical lipomatous tumour, but the absence of copy number gains or losses is consistent with the impression that herniated orbital fat is a reactive process. Genetic analysis may be another method to help differentiate herniated orbital fat from a lipomatous orbital tumour when the diagnosis is in question.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27508976', '_score': 239.42268, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'MDM2 and CDK4 Immunohistochemistry: Should It Be Used in Problematic Differentiated Lipomatous Tumors?: A New Perspective.\n\n\nAlthough most cases of atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL) can be diagnosed solely on the basis of histologic features, those lacking diagnostic histologic features require ancillary studies for accurate classification. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for amplification of MDM2 has been considered the gold standard for diagnosis in these situations. Immunostaining for MDM2 and/or CDK4 has been adopted as a surrogate method because of its high concordance rate with FISH and lower cost. However, studies examining the concordance of the 2 methods have been based preferentially on cases in which the diagnosis could be established histologically. No study has explored the concordance between the 2 methods in histologically ambiguous cases or in cases in which the diagnosis of ALT/WDL is not apparent after a review of all slides. To address this, we performed immunostaining for MDM2 and CDK4 on 183 well-differentiated lipomatous tumors that could not be diagnosed on purely histologic grounds and that were, therefore, subjected to FISH analysis. These included ALT/WDLs (n=56), lipomas (n=96), and lipoma variants (n=31). Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 was noted in 25/56 and 23/56 ALT/WDL, respectively, giving a sensitivity of 45% and 41% and a specificity of 98% and 92%. Staining was noted exclusively in the nuclei of atypical cells and not in the nuclei of adipocytes. Staining for MDM2 and CDK4 occurred in 2/125 and 10/117 benign lipomatous lesions, respectively. False-positive staining was equivalent in intensity to ALT/WDL. We conclude that MDM2 and CDK4 staining is a relatively insensitive method for diagnosing ALT/WDL in cases that are histologically ambiguous, as staining is restricted to neoplastic cells with atypia that are underrepresented in these cases. Therefore, in cases like ours that closely simulate clinical practice, FISH is the more reliable and cost-effective option.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23591942', '_score': 239.37015, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/etiology [Q000209:major]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Neoplasm, Residual [D018365:minor]', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant [D018714:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male [D005834:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate [D053208:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Paratesticular liposarcoma: unusual patterns of recurrence and importance of margins.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Paratesticular liposarcoma (LPS) is a rare entity for which optimal treatment has not been defined.

LRFS rates at 3 and 5 years were 76 and 67 %. The 3-year LRFS rates were lower in patients with positive margins compared with those with negative margins (29 vs 100 %, p = .0005) and in patients with recurrent versus primary disease (38 vs 83 %, p = .04). Among patients who received surgery and RT, margins remained a significant predictor of local recurrence (p = .009).

Tumor size (21 tumors) varied from 7.5 to 25 cm (mean, 17.5). Histopathologically, DD component was high grade in 19 (76%) and low grade in 6 (24%) tumors.

In an univariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model, we found that the risk of a tumor-related death for STS patients with methylated RASSF1A was significantly increased (RR = 2.9; p = 0.037). In summary, our data indicate that inactivation of RASSF1A is a common event in STS, especially in leiomyosarcoma.

Classic cytogenetic banding techniques have proved insufficient to identify the genomic composition and structure of such rings and markers, but fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies have shown that they consist mainly of amplified material from chromosome 12, more specifically from bands 12q13-->q15. We have used the new FISH-based screening techniques comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and multicolor-FISH (M-FISH) in combination with G-banding and analysis by chromosome- and locus-specific fluorescent in situ probes to examine in detail the karyotypic characteristics of 22 lipomatous tumors, most of them classified histologically as well-differentiated liposarcomas, selected because they had been shown to harbor rings and/or marker chromosomes. M-FISH, in contrast to G- banding, was found to be informative with regard to the chromosomal origin of the rings and other markers present, whereas CGH and hybridizations with locus-specific probes helped identify which subchromosomal regions were involved.

The tumors occurred most commonly in the muscles of the extremity (46 cases), followed by the retroperitoneum (23 cases), groin (14 cases), and miscellaneous sites (nine cases). Tumors in the retroperitoneum recurred in nearly all cases (21 of 23 cases), occasionally caused patient death, and dedifferentiated in four cases (median time to dedifferentiation, 8 years). Tumors in the groin had a similar high recurrence rate (11 of 14 cases), caused death of patients (two of 14 cases), and dedifferentiated (four of 14 cases). In contrast, those in the extremity recurred less frequently (20 of 46 cases) and had no disease-related mortality. Three of 46, however, underwent dedifferentiation (median time to dedifferentiation, 7 years). Of the 11 cases that underwent dedifferentiation, the interval between diagnosis and dedifferentiation ranged from 2 to 18 years (median time, 9 years; average time, 11 years). Six of the 11 patients showed dedifferentiated foci in the first recurrence, and three died of metastatic disease. Our study indicates that the behavior of well-differentiated liposarcomas is strongly influenced by location. Although the prevailing view is that dedifferentiation is restricted to tumors of the retroperitoneum, our study indicates that it is not a site-specific phenomenon, but is more likely a time-dependent phenomenon seen in situations with a high likelihood for clinical persistence of disease for a long period. Dedifferentiation identifies a tumor that is potentially more aggressive; yet the progression of the disease following dedifferentiation may be highly variable and probably depends on a number of factors, including the amount of dedifferentiation and type of therapy. Although atypical lipoma is an acceptable term for well-differentiated liposarcomas of the subcutis, it fails to convey the potentially life-threatening properties of retroperitoneal tumors.

The amount of fat within the tumors was visually graded from the images as: none, 1-75%, 75-95% or 95-100%. The structure of non-fatty tumor components was compared. The images were compared to histopathology and in 37 cases to cytogenetic findings.\n\nRESULTS: Only 4 of 20 liposarcomas contained fat. All 4 lesions, histopathologically diagnosed as atypical lipomatous tumors, contained fat but less than 75% of tumor volume. All lesions with more fat than 75% of tumor volume were histologically diagnosed as lipomas. However, one-third of the karyotyped lipomas had ring chromosomes which are considered typical for atypical lipomatous tumors.\n\nCONCLUSION: When a tumor is composed more or less solely of fat, the diagnosis of a lipoma or atypical lipomatous tumor with a phenotype simulating a lipoma can be assumed. When the fat content is less than 75% of the tumor volume or non-fatty nodules are found, biopsies from different tumor components have to be performed to exclude malignancy. When no fat is found, imaging does not help in differentiating lipoma or liposarcoma from other soft tissue tumors.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '21117066', '_score': 235.0654, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adipocytes [D017667:minor]/cytology [Q000166:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA Copy Number Variations [D056915:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Expression Profiling [D020869:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'MicroRNAs [D035683:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Sex Factors [D012737:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1 [D002878:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6 [D002896:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization [D055028:major]'], 'text': 'Evaluation of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas by high-resolution oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization.\n\n\nWell-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLS/DDLS) encompass an intriguing disease model in which a temporal intersection occurs between the malignant transformation of mesenchymal cells and the process of adipogenesis.

We found that the in vitro stimulation of DDLPS cells with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) elevated the degree of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway signaling, and that pro-tumorigenic phenotypes such as cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were significantly enhanced. Conversely, Met knockdown using shRNA-mediated interference decreased HGF-induced Met signaling, the invasive and migratory nature of DDLPS cells in vitro, and the tumorigenicity of DDLPS cells in vivo. These data strongly support the role for Met as a DDLPS therapeutic target. To that end, using EMD1214063, an ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor that targets Met more specifically than other kinases, inhibited Met-dependent signaling, reduced the oncogenicity of DDLPS cells in vitro, and significantly increased the survival of nude mice bearing subcutaneous DDLPS xenografts.

A multigene predictor for distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was developed by the supervised principal component method. Expression levels of the 588 genes in the predictor were used to calculate a risk score for each patient. In validation of the predictor in the test set, patients with low risk score had a 3-year DRFS of 83% versus 45% for high risk score patients (P = 0.001). The HR for high versus low score, adjusted for histologic subtype, was 4.42 (95% CI, 1.26-15.55; P = 0.021). The concordance probability for risk score was 0.732. In contrast, the concordance probability for histologic subtype, which had been considered the best predictor of outcome in liposarcoma, was 0.669. Genes related to adipogenesis, DNA replication, mitosis, and spindle assembly checkpoint control were all highly represented in the multigene predictor. Three genes from the predictor, TOP2A, PTK7, and CHEK1, were found to be overexpressed in liposarcoma samples of all five subtypes and in liposarcoma cell lines. RNAi-mediated knockdown of these genes in liposarcoma cell lines reduced proliferation and invasiveness and increased apoptosis.

During the assessment of angiogenesis and vascular invasion in a thymic carcinoid tumor, we observed unexpected immunostaining for CD31 in perithymic brown fat nests.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether CD31 is expressed by normal and neoplastic cells of brown fat, a tissue whose thermogenetic activity depends heavily on high perfusion.\n\nDESIGN: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues were immunostained by the labeled avidin-biotin method using antibodies against CD31 (clones JC70A and 1A10) after retrieval of heat-induced epitopes. Archival tissues included perithymic, periadrenal, axillary, and neck adipose tissue in which were embedded nests of brown fat (n = 15), hibernoma (n = 3), lipoma (n = 6), well-differentiated liposarcoma (n = 4), and myxoid liposarcoma (n = 4).\n\nRESULTS: Invariably, multivacuolated and univacuolated adipocytes of normal brown fat and hibernomas were intensely positive for the CD31 antigen. The immunostaining "decorated" cell membranes and the membranes of intracytoplasmic vacuoles. No expression of CD31 was found in normal adipocytes of white fat, in neoplastic cells of lipomas, or in multivacuolated lipoblasts of well-differentiated and myxoid liposarcomas.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of cell types that express CD31 is expanded to include normal and neoplastic brown fat cells. We speculate that the expression of CD31 may play a role in the development and maintenance of the vascular network characterizing this specialized adipose tissue. Moreover, CD31 may inhibit the Bax-mediated apoptosis of brown fat cells.

Immunohistochemistry for desmin, h-caldesmon, S100, and MDM2, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for the t(12;16) (q13;p11) were performed in all cases.\n\nRESULT: Patients ranged in age from 49 to 70 (mean, 59) years. The tumors were centered in the myometrium, ranged in size from 10 to 18.5 cm, and showed a gelatinous cut surface with foci of necrosis. On microscopic examination, the tumors had well-circumscribed pushing margins. One neoplasm was uniformly hypocellular with a prominent myxoid background, and a striking delicate vascular network. Another neoplasm showed alternating hypocellular (myxoid) and hypercellular areas, whereas the third tumor was uniformly hypercellular with a hyalinized background. In the myxoid areas, the cells were small and spindle with oval nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. In the hypercellular areas, the cells were pleomorphic with large, hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitotic activity ranged from <3 to 7/10 high-power fields. Lipoblasts were present in all tumors but were more common in the hypercellular areas. Two tumors merged imperceptibly with a lipoleiomyoma (1 typical and 1 with bizarre nuclei), whereas the third tumor showed an infarcted area composed of ghost mature adipocytes admixed with hyalinized smooth muscle most consistent with an infarcted lipoleiomyoma. Tumors were classified as myxoid, mixed myxoid and pleomorphic, and pleomorphic liposarcoma, respectively. The benign and malignant adipose components were positive for S100, whereas the benign smooth muscle component stained for desmin and h-caldesmon. MDM2 immunostain was positive in the 2 cases with a pleomorphic liposarcoma component. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was successfully completed in only 1 of 3 tumors (pure pleomorphic liposarcoma), which failed to show the t(12;16) and HMAG2 amplification. The patients are alive and well 1, 2, and 20 years after initial surgery with no adjuvant therapy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Primary liposarcomas of the uterus are extremely rare and are most likely to arise from malignant transformation of a lipoleiomyoma.

After 17 d in culture, SW872 cells contained significantly more cholesterol (100%) and triglyceride (3-fold) and secreted more apoC-I [4 vs. 17 d: 0.11 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.01 pmol/(10(6) cells . 24 h), P < 0.001] and apoE [0.7 +/- 0.1 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3 pmol/(10(6) cells . 24 h), P < 0.001]. Cellular apoC-I increased 7-fold and apoE increased 16-fold. Cell maturation was associated with significantly higher levels of apoE mRNA but not apoC-I mRNA. Increases in cell lipids, apoC-I, and apoE were not dependent on the presence of extracellular lipids because similar changes occurred in cells incubated with lipoprotein-deficient serum or in cells incubated without serum. Treatment (7 d) of cells during maturation with insulin (10 or 1000 nmol/L) significantly reduced the secretion of apoC-I and apoE. These results demonstrate that in maturing SW872 cells, cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation in the presence or absence of extracellular lipids, is associated with increased apoC-I and apoE production. Furthermore, apoC-I and apoE production are differentially regulated at the transcriptional level, and long-term treatment with insulin has an inhibitory rather than stimulatory effect on apoC-I and apoE production.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19004727', '_score': 232.1083, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Angiogenesis Inhibitors [D020533:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors [D046152:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors [D047428:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]'], 'text': "[Targeted therapy of sarcomas].\n\n\nRecent progress made in the field of sarcoma biology has shed new light on the pathophysiology of these numerous but rare diseases.

All xenografts recapitulated morphological and gene expression characteristics of the patient tumors after continuous in vivo passages. Importantly, xenograftability was directly correlated with disease-specific survival of liposarcoma patients. Thus, the ability for the tumor of a patient to engraft may help identify those patients who will benefit from more aggressive treatment regimens. Gene expression analyses highlighted the association between xenograftability and a unique gene expression signature, including down-regulated PTEN tumor-suppressor gene expression and a progenitor-like phenotype.

The histomorphology is a continuum between highly differentiated myxoid and poorly differentiated round cell components. The gold standard of diagnosis is dependent on histomorphology and/or identification of t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation by cytogenetics or demonstration of DDIT3 rearrangements by fluorescence in situ hybridization. There are currently no diagnostic immunohistochemical stains available. The broad range of myxoid neoplasms in the differential diagnosis includes a variety of sarcomas. Given the notable differences in disease biology among myxoid neoplasms, which range from benign to aggressive, an accurate diagnosis is imperative for proper treatment and prognostication. Prompted by our recent study showing frequent expression of the cancer testis antigen NY-ESO-1 in myxoid and round cell liposarcomas, we sought to evaluate the utility of NY-ESO-1 as an immunohistochemical marker for myxoid and round cell liposarcoma among mesenchymal myxoid neoplasms within the differential diagnosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were obtained for the following mesenchymal myxoid neoplasms (n=138): myxoid and round cell liposarcoma (n=38); well-differentiated liposarcoma (n=12); lipoma (n=20; 4 with myxoid change); extra-cardiac soft tissue myxoma (n=39); extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (n=12); myxofibrosarcoma (n=10: 5 low grade, 2 intermediate grade, 3 high grade); and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (n=7). Utilizing standard immunohistochemistry protocols, full sections were stained with NY-ESO-1 (clone E978), and staining was assessed for intensity (1-2+), percentage of tumor positivity, and location. In all, 36/38 (95%) of the myxoid and round cell liposarcomas demonstrated NY-ESO-1 immunoreactivity.

One mechanism is by genomic amplification and consequent overexpression of the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2, which targets p53 for proteosome-mediated degradation. The MDM2 gene is amplified in >95% of human liposarcomas, a disease for which the efficacy of systemic therapies is limited. Here, we compared the effects of two novel highly potent and selective inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction, with the classic MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 on the expression and activity of p53 and the resulting changes in human liposarcoma cell proliferation and survival. We determined MDM2 copy number, p53 mutational status, and relative expression levels of MDM2 and p53 proteins in 8 human liposarcoma cell lines and normal human preadipocytes/adipocytes. TP53 status was wild type in 7 of 8 liposarcoma cell lines, which also had genomic amplification of MDM2. MDM2 protein expression correlated with the degree of amplification and was highly expressed in comparison to normal preadipocytes/adipocytes. The two spiro-oxindole derivatives - Compounds A and B- (1) and Nutlin-3 were applied to liposarcoma cell lines with or without p53 siRNA and the biological consequences were determined by immunoblot, cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Treatment with MDM2 inhibitors led to increased p53 protein levels and induction of its transcriptional targets MDM2 and p21. Cell viability was markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner in liposarcoma cells with wild-type p53, with IC50 values of 0.40-4.23 M, 0.37-1.88 M and 2.72-9.83 M for Compound A, Compound B, and Nutlin-3, respectively. These effects were markedly abrogated by siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown and in a cell line harboring a de novo p53 mutation. Compound A and Compound B also induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis at approximately 5 fold lower concentrations than Nutlin-3. At low concentrations, G0/G1 cell arrest occurred, whereas higher concentrations resulted in G2/M arrest and induction of apoptosis. Cell line and tumor xenograft experiments are ongoing. These data demonstrate that Compounds A and B are highly potent and specific inhibitors of MDM2 with activity in genetically characterized liposarcoma cells. Further study and clinical development in this disease is warranted. 1.

The patients included 20 men and 12 women, mean age, 60 years (range, 33 to 80 years). Twenty-seven tumors were located in the retroperitoneum and 5 in the mesentery.

Twenty-four (75%) patients developed local recurrences, 3 (9%) had distant metastasis, and 16 (50%) died of the disease. The predominant histology of dedifferentiation (DD) included fibrosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in 15 (47%), myxofibrosarcoma (myxoid MFH) in 5 (16%), mixed type in 10 (31%), and a whorling pattern in 2 (6%).

These tumors have been considered variants of well-differentiated LPS (WDL), myxoid LPS, and spindle cell lipoma, suggesting that this is a heterogenous group of lesions. Using strict morphologic criteria and molecular and immunohistochemical analyses, we have identified a homogenous group of spindle cell lipomatous tumors, histologically and genetically distinct from other forms of LPS, which we have called "fibrosarcoma-like lipomatous neoplasm." Cases classified as "spindle cell LPS" or "low-grade LPS with spindle cell features" were reviewed. Final selection criteria included: (1) an exclusive low-grade spindle cell component resembling fibrosarcoma; (2) a mixture of bland fibroblastic cells resembling the preadipocyte and early-adipocyte stage of embryonic fat; and (3) molecular-genetic analysis that excluded other forms of lipomatous tumors. Of the initial 25 cases identified, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was uninformative in 2 cases; 5 were reclassified as WDL on the basis of molecular data (MDM2 amplification) and 6 as spindle cell lipoma (CGH profiles with a few gains and losses including a constant loss of chromosome 13 and frequent losses of chromosomes 16 and 6). The 12 remaining cases showed flat CGH profiles; of these cases, 11 were negative for DDIT3 gene rearrangements, and 1 result was uninterpretable. Patients ranged in age from 15 to 82 years (mean 50 y); male patients were affected slightly more often (7:5).

Clinical follow-up in 11 patients (9 mo to 20 y; mean 68 mo) showed no recurrences or metastases.

Combining these two fields, we have developed a method for the simultaneous visualization of several physically defined segments along a chromosome. Seven YAC clones and one subtelomeric cosmid clone from chromosome 12 were labeled with unique combinations of four fluors and hybridized to metaphase chromosomes from neoplastic cells. In a uterine leiomyoma and a myxoid liposarcoma with translocations 12;14 and 12;16, the breakpoints in chromosome 12 could be localized to the HMGIC and CHOP regions, respectively. In the other tumors, more complex aberrations were visualized, including two inversions in 12q with a common breakpoint between MDM2 and D12S332 in a pleomorphic adenoma, amplification of MDM2 and CDK4 in ring chromosomes from a malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and amplification of KRAS2 together with other unbalanced rearrangements in two pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that trabectedin is particularly effective against myxoid liposarcomas where response is associated to regression of capillary networks. Here, we investigated the mechanism of the antiangiogenic activity of trabectedin in myxoid liposarcomas. Trabectedin directly targeted endothelial cells, impairing functions relying on extracellular matrix remodeling (invasion and branching morphogenesis) through the upregulation of the inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Increased TIMPs synthesis by the tumor microenvironment following trabectedin treatment was confirmed in xenograft models of myxoid liposarcoma. In addition, trabectedin upregulated tumor cell expression of the endogenous inhibitor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1, a key regulator of angiogenesis-dependent dormancy in sarcoma), in in vivo models of myxoid liposarcomas, in vitro cell lines and primary cell cultures from patients' myxoid liposarcomas. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that trabectedin displaced the master regulator of adipogenesis C/EBPβ from the TSP-1 promoter, indicating an association between the up-regulation of TSP-1 and induction of adipocytic differentiation program by trabectedin.

Thirty patients (35%) developed metastasis; 27 (31%) died from the disease.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: With multivariate analysis, age ( > 45 years), percent of round cell differentiation ( > or = 25%), and the presence of spontaneous tumor necrosis are significantly associated with a poor prognosis.

We measured the levels of expression of HMGA2 mRNA and of eight members of the let-7 microRNA family using quantitative RT-PCR and expression of HMGA2 protein using immunohistochemistry. HMGA2 was highly overexpressed in 100% of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WDLPS/DDLPS), all with HMGA2 amplification, and 100% of lipomas with HMGA2 rearrangement.

WDLPS is typically low grade, whereas DDLPS is high grade, aggressive, and carries a worse prognosis. WDLPS and DDLPS frequently co-occur in patients. However, it is not clear whether DDLPS arises independently from WDLPS, or whether epigenomic alterations underly the histopathological differences of these subtypes. Here, we profiled 9 epigenetic marks in tumor samples from 151 patients with LPS and showed elevated trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3K9me3) levels in DDLPS tumors. Integrated ChIP-seq and gene expression analyses of patient-derived cell lines revealed that H3K9me3 mediates differential regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation and migration. Among these, Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) was reduced in DDLPS, with increased H3K9me3 at associated regulatory regions. Pharmacologic inhibition of H3K9me3 with chaetocin decreased DDLPS proliferation and increased expression of the adipogenesis-associated factors PPARγ, CEBPα, and CEBPβ, suggesting that increased H3K9me3 may mediate DDLPS-associated aggressiveness and dedifferentiation properties. KLF6 overexpression partially phenocopied chaetocin treatment in DDLPS cells and induced phenotypic changes that were consistent with adipocytic differentiation, suggesting that the effects of increased H3K9me3 may be mediated through KLF6.

In GIST cells with KIT mutations, selinexor induced G1- arrest without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation and irrespective of RB expression.

Fatty acid synthase (FAS) is a key enzyme of de-novo fatty acid synthesis and is highly expressed in both human liposarcoma tissue specimens and LiSa-2 cells. Treatment of the LiSa-2 cell line with the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic imidazolide (CDDO-Im) markedly inhibited FAS mRNA expression, FAS protein production and FAS gene promoter activity. As expected, fatty acid synthesis was down regulated, but there was no effect on cellular fatty acid uptake or glycerol-3-phosphate synthesis suggesting a selective inhibition of endogenous fatty acid synthesis. Importantly, CDDO-Im produced a dose-dependent apoptotic effect in the LiSa-2 cell line, and simultaneous treatment with CDDO-Im and the fatty acid synthase inhibitor Cerulenin produced a synergistic cytotoxic effect. Thus, CDDO-Im and Cerulenin act at different loci to inhibit long chain fatty acid synthesis in liposarcoma cells.

Definitive treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins for resectable disease. However, well-differentiated liposarcomas that are large or difficult to operate upon should be followed with close surveillance as long as there is no radiologic concern for a dedifferentiated component.

In the second- and third-line setting, myxoid liposarcomas, in particular, seem to be sensitive to trabectedin, which was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Eribulin offered a survival benefit when compared with dacarbazine in the third-line setting in liposarcomas (other than the well-differentiated subtype) and is now FDA approved.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used frequently to detect this amplification and aid with the diagnosis of these entities, which is difficult by morphology alone. Recently, bright-field in situ hybridization techniques such as chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) have been introduced for the determination of MDM2 amplification status.\n\nMETHODS: The present study compared the results of FISH and CISH for detecting MDM2 amplification in 41 cases of adipocytic tumors.

Two cases had discordant results between CISH and FISH, and two cases were not interpretable by CISH.\n\nCONCLUSION: CISH is advantageous for allowing pathologists to evaluate the histologic and molecular alterations occurring simultaneously in a specimen.

The histologic composition of these tumors is variable, but diagnosis requires the presence of both epithelial and mesenchymal malignant components. We report 4 additional cases, with an emphasis on unusual histologic features.\n\nMETHODS: Histologic and immunohistochemical examinations were performed on bladder tumors from 4 patients. Clinicopathologic features of previously reported and current cases were reviewed and summarized.\n\nRESULTS: Four patients (3 men, 1 woman) age 54 to 77 years were found to have polypoid masses in the urinary bladder. In all cases, histologic examination showed biphasic neoplasms with distinct mesenchymal and epithelial components. The morphologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of the tumors varied. One of the cases was remarkable for the presence of liposarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and micropapillary urothelial carcinoma. Two of the patients died 2 years after diagnosis, which is consistent with the previously reported aggressive nature of urinary bladder carcinosarcomas.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Carcinosarcomas of the urinary bladder are rare, aggressive malignant neoplasms. To our knowledge, a liposarcomatous component has been reported in only 1 case previously, and components of micropapillary urothelial carcinoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor have not been reported previously in carcinosarcomas of the urinary bladder.

CMR was positively correlated with intra-operative bleeding (correlation coefficient = 0.514, P = 0.010). Six cases with severe postoperative complications were recorded. Patients with tumor sizes greater than 20 cm carried a significant risk of profuse intra-operative bleeding (P = 0.009). The ratio of a highly malignant subtype (dedifferentiated or pleomorphic) in recurrent cases was higher compared to primary cases (P = 0.027). Both single-factor survival using the Kaplan-Meier model and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that overall survival was correlated with resection extent and pathological subtype (P < 0.001 and P = 0.02), however, relapse-free interval (RFI) was only correlated with resection extent (P = 0.002).\n\nCONCLUSION: Close follow-up should be conducted in patients with RAL.

Tumors were evaluated according to size, localization, tumor border, and structure as well as tumor composition. These imaging criteria were correlated with histopathological findings.\n\nRESULTS: Nineteen myxoid liposarcomas were histologically classified as low-grade myxoid liposarcomas, whereas 11 were considered high-grade myxoid liposarcomas. Mean tumor volume of low-grade myxoid liposarcomas (710.1 ± 960.1 ccm) was significantly smaller as compared to high-grade myxoid liposarcomas (2737.0 ± 3423.7 ccm; P = 0.04).

The primary end point was overall survival (OS), secondary end points were disease control-progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression, objective response rate, and duration of response-as well as safety and patient-reported symptom scoring.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 518 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either trabectedin (n = 345) or dacarbazine (n = 173). In the final analysis of PFS, trabectedin administration resulted in a 45% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with dacarbazine (median PFS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 4.2 v 1.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.55; P < .001); benefits were observed across all preplanned subgroup analyses. The interim analysis of OS (64% censored) demonstrated a 13% reduction in risk of death in the trabectedin arm compared with dacarbazine (median OS for trabectedin v dacarbazine, 12.4 v 12.9 months; hazard ratio, 0.87; P = .37). The safety profiles were consistent with the well-characterized toxicities of both agents, and the most common grade 3 to 4 adverse effects were myelosuppression and transient elevation of transaminases in the trabectedin arm.\n\nCONCLUSION: Trabectedin demonstrates superior disease control versus conventional dacarbazine in patients who have advanced liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma after they experience failure of prior chemotherapy.

Although historically used for traumatic pancreatic transection and chronic pancreatitis, it currently is reserved for selective management of pancreatic neck lesions that are benign or have low malignant potential. Varying morbidity rates have been published in the literature. Our objectives were to describe the technique and determine the safety and effectiveness of central pancreatectomy in the excision of benign or low-malignant potential lesions of the pancreatic neck.\n\nDESIGN: Retrospective clinicopathologic data review.\n\nSETTING: The Mayo Clinic surgical index was used to identify procedures matched for central, median, middle, or middle segment pancreatectomy.\n\nPATIENTS: Eight patients (4 men, 4 women) underwent central pancreatectomy between 1998 and 2004.\n\nINTERVENTION: Patients with pancreatic neck or proximal body masses underwent central pancreatectomy at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were followed up closely for postoperative complications during the initial hospital admission. On follow-up, long-term endocrine and exocrine function were determined based on laboratory values and patient history.\n\nRESULTS: Abnormalities included 3 islet cell tumors, 2 serous cystadenomas, a mucinous cystadenoma, a lymphoepithelial cyst, and a recurrent liposarcoma. Mean tumor size was 2.8 cm and mean operative time was 4.8 hours with a mean blood loss of 381 mL. The most common complication was pancreatic leak (5 patients [63%]). Reoperation was necessary in 2 patients (25%), both secondary to hemorrhage. There was no mortality or new-onset diabetes mellitus. One patient transiently required oral pancreatic enzyme supplementation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Central pancreatectomy may preserve endocrine and exocrine function. While mortality is low, in our experience, central pancreatectomy is associated with a high complication rate. The most common complication is pancreatic leak. Caution is necessary when using central pancreatectomy in the treatment of pancreatic neck lesions. Surgeon experience is of utmost importance in this decision-making process as well as the technical aspects of central pancreatectomy.

The pathologic diagnosis using CNB was compared with that using surgical specimens. Diagnostic accuracy was analyzed using Chi-square test, with respect to the histologic pattern (such as spindle cell and myxoid), biologic behavior (benign versus malignant) and immunohistochemical results. The 59 cases of sarcoma were subdivided into three grades according to FNCLCC grading system.\n\nRESULTS: Histologic diagnosis could be made in 84.0% (89/106) cases. Thirteen cases were non-diagnostic on CNB. There were 4 cases on CNB showing diagnostic discrepancy with surgical specimens. Four cases of "benign lesions" on CNB found to be myxoid liposarcoma and lipoma-like liposarcoma upon resection. In general, myxoid pattern (9/17) seen on CNB showed less diagnostic correlation with surgical specimens, as compared to spindle cell and other histologic patterns (P < 0.01). The rate of diagnostic correlation was 79.7% (49/59) for the 59 cases of sarcoma studied, with grade 2 and grade 3 sarcoma showing better correlation (in contrast to 7/17 for grade 1 sarcoma) (P < 0.01). Comparative analysis showed no significant difference between benign/borderline tumors and sarcomas. The application of immunohistochemical study did not result in significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy on CNB.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided CNB is a reliable tool in pathologic diagnosis of soft tissue tumors and shows a high accuracy rate especially for high-grade sarcoma. Tumors with myxoid pattern, lipomatous tumors and grade 1 sarcomas are associated with lower diagnostic accuracy on CNB.

Twelve patients had malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 5 had liposarcoma, 6 had leiomyosarcoma, and 1 had rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\nRESULTS: Telomerase activity was detected in 4 sarcoma samples (17%), all of which were positive for hTR. Expression of hTR was demonstrated in 13 sarcomas (54%), 4 of which were positive for telomerase and 9 of which were negative for telomerase. One (50%) of 2 grade 1 tumors, 9 (50%) of 18 grade 2 tumors, and 3 (75%) of 4 grade 3 tumors showed hTR expression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The relatively low frequency of telomerase activity in soft tissue sarcomas suggests that telomerase may not play an important role in tumorigenesis in these tumors. Telomerase ladders were demonstrated only in association with tumors expressing hTR. It is noteworthy that half of the patients with grade 1 and 2 tumors expressed hTR, suggesting that telomerase RNA may be useful as a marker for identifying tumor aggressiveness earlier than the conventional histopathologic grading scale.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8159840', '_score': 216.38388, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]', 'Neoplasms, Bone Tissue [D018213:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Osseointegration [D016348:minor]', 'Osteosarcoma [D012516:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Tissue Preservation [D014021:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Transplantation, Autologous [D014182:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Bone Neoplasms [D001859:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Bone Transplantation [D016025:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Chondrosarcoma [D002813:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Hot Temperature [D006358:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': '[Autoclaved tumoral autografts.

The median age was 49 (19-71) years. The median time to abdominal metastasis from diagnosis of the primary was 27 (8-91) months.

Emergency laparotomy was done for perforative peritonitis (n = 2), intussusception (n = 2), and bleed in spleen (n = 1). Two patients were asymptomatic. The common histologies were myxoid liposarcoma (n = 6) and leiomyosarcoma (n = 4). The median follow-up of survivors post metastasis was 12 months.

Among 98 other human sarcomas of various types, CHOP was amplified in a hemangiopericytoma, a liposarcoma, and two osteosarcoma. High constitutive expression levels of CHOP were observed in tumors with gene amplification, but also in some other samples. The nearby MDM2 gene, which codes for a protein that may inactivate wild-type p53, has previously been reported to be frequently amplified in sarcoma. In our sarcoma panel, MDM2 was amplified in 9 cases. MDM2 and CHOP were co-amplified in two of these, whereas the two osteosarcomas had amplified CHOP but not MDM2. CHOP was amplified in both cell lines with GLI amplification, and MDM2 only in one. No mutations in the TP53 gene have been found in samples with amplification of MDM2.

Our aim was to evaluate the added value of MDM2 amplification and DDIT3 rearrangement in making a diagnosis and classifying lipogenic tumors.\n\nMETHODS: Eighty-two cases of liposarcoma and 60 lipomas diagnosed between 1995 and 2010 were analysed for MDM2 amplification and DDIT3 rearrangement using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The subtypes of liposarcoma were reclassified according to the molecular results, whose results were reviewed with an analysis of the relevant histologic and immunohistochemical findings.\n\nRESULTS: One case of lipoma (1.67%) was reclassified as a WDLPS. Of the liposarcomas, 13.4% (16/82) were reclassified after the molecular testing. Five cases of MLPS were reclassified as four cases of DDLPS and one case of myxoid lipoma. Two cases of WDLPS were reclassified as one case of spindle cell lipoma and another case of myxofibrosarcoma. Four cases of DDLPS were reclassified as two cases of leiomyosarcoma, one case of angiomyolipoma and another case of fibroinflammatory lesion.

We hypothesized that liposarcomas would be similarly susceptible to the apoptotic effects of an HIV protease inhibitor, nelfinavir.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase I trial of nelfinavir for liposarcomas. There was no limit to prior chemotherapy. The starting dose was 1,250 mg twice daily (Level 1). Doses were escalated in cohorts of three to a maximally evaluated dose of 4,250 mg (Level 5). One cycle was 28 days. Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PKs) for nelfinavir and its primary active metabolite, M8, were determined at Levels 4 (3,000 mg) and 5.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty subjects (13 males) were enrolled. Median (range) age was 64 years (37-81). One subject at Level 1 experienced reversible, grade 3 pancreatitis after 1 week and was replaced. No other dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Median (range) number of cycles was 3 (0.6-13.5). Overall best responses observed were 1 partial response, 1 minor response, 4 stable disease, and 13 progressive disease. Mean peak plasma levels and AUCs for nelfinavir were higher at Level 4 (7.3 mg/L; 60.9 mg/L × h) than 5 (6.3 mg/L; 37.7 mg/L × h). The mean ratio of M8:nelfinavir AUCs for both levels was ~1:3.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PKs demonstrate auto-induction of nelfinavir clearance at the doses studied, although the mechanism remains unclear. Peak plasma concentrations were within range where anticancer activity was demonstrated in vitro. M8 metabolite is present at ~1/3 the level of nelfinavir and may also contribute to the anticancer activity observed.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24085323', '_score': 210.7685, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Anti-Bacterial Agents [D000900:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Dexamethasone [D003907:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Doxycycline [D004318:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Fibrosarcoma [D005354:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Interleukin-1beta [D053583:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Lipopolysaccharides [D008070:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 [D020778:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 [D020780:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors [D061965:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents [D000893:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Sarcoma, Synovial [D013584:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate [D013755:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Tretinoin [D014212:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha [D014409:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Antioxidants [D000975:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Carcinogens [D002273:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Catechin [D002392:minor]/analogs & derivatives [Q000031:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Chondrosarcoma [D002813:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Dactinomycin [D003609:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]'], 'text': 'In vitro modulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in adult human sarcoma cell lines by cytokines, inducers and inhibitors.\n\n\nThe highly aggressive adult sarcomas are characterized by high levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9, which play crucial roles in tumor invasion and metastasis by degradation of the extracellular membrane leading to cancer cell spread to distal organs.

Analysis of gene expression profiling of human sarcomas revealed tightly clustered groups and could denote the existence of common signalling pathways for each branch. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are grouped into two main types: (a) sarcomas showing specific genetic alterations and relatively simple karyotypes, and translocations which originate gene fusions (e.g., EWS-FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma); or specific genetic mutations (e.g., c-kit in the gastrointestinal stromal tumour), and (b) sarcomas showing unspecific gene alterations and very complex karyotypes, and very numerous gains and losses.

This is less often the case in sarcomas in that both children and adults are treated similarly. However, different types of sarcomas are most typical in these populations, and our understanding of these cancers in one group has provided direction for understanding them in the other group. For example, advances at the molecular level in Ewing sarcoma, a disease that affects predominantly children, helped spearhead the uncovering of several signature translocations in adult sarcomas, such as synovial sarcoma and myxoid liposarcomas. The success of chemotherapy in pediatric sarcomas continues to be a benchmark for adult sarcomas to emulate. Conversely, the demonstration of the viability of limb-sparing surgery combined with adjuvant radiation in adult extremity sarcomas helped advance that treatment approach in pediatric sarcomas. To illustrate some of these concepts and to enhance our understanding of sarcomas across the age spectrum, 4 types of sarcoma are discussed. The first 2 are Ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma seen mainly, but not exclusively, in children. The other 2 are synovial sarcoma, which can be looked at as a bridge between pediatric and adult sarcomas as it affects mainly young adults, and liposarcoma that is almost exclusively an adult sarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_166807-176', '_score': 208.28989, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: Clinical next-generation sequencing in sarcomas.\n\n\n\nBackground: There are currently no FDA approved targeted therapies for sarcomas except GIST. Complicating this is the extreme diversity, heterogeneity, and rarity of these neoplasms. Few therapeutic options exist for relapsed and refractory sarcomas. In clinical practice many oncologists refer patients for genomic profiling hoping for guidance on treatment options after standard therapy. We analyzed clinical next generation exome sequencing (NGS) results in patients with advanced sarcomas to discover potentially actionable aberrations and their frequency in a clinical setting. Methods: We reviewed charts of patients with advanced sarcoma referred to investigational cancer therapeutics department and had CLIA certified comprehensive genomic profiling of 200- 315 cancer genes in at least 50ng of DNA. Actionable aberrations were defined as those identifying anti-cancer drugs on the market, in registered clinical trials, or in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database. Results: Among the 98 patients analyzed median age was 33.5 years (range 10-76), M: F ratio 47:51. Common sarcoma types were de-differentiated lipo (N = 20; 20%), leiomyo (n = 11; 11%), osteo (n = 9; 9%), well-differentiated lipo (n = 7; 7%), rhabdomyo (n = 6; 6%), carcino, GIST, spindle cell, and unclassified (N = 5 each; 5%). Seventy percent (69/98) of patients had > 1 potentially actionable genomic aberration. The most common aberrations involved CDK4 amplification (n = 22; 22%), CDKN2A/B loss or mutation (n = 16; 16 %), and MDM2 amplification (n = 21; 21%, non-liposarcoma = 4),. Other notably targetable mutations occurring more rarely included PIK3CA, NOTCH2, NTRK1/3, KDR and PDGFR. Novel fusions were characterized (KIAA1549:BRAF and DCTN1-ALK) that molecularly matched to therapy with patient benefit. Interesting cases included a patient with 3 EWS rearrangements (EWSR1-FLI1, CENPP-EWSR1, ETS1-EWSR1) and re-classification of an unclassified sarcoma to Ewings. Conclusions: Incorporating NGS into sarcoma management may allow for more precise diagnosis and sub-classification of this diverse and rare disease. Matching patients to inhibitors targeting CDK, MDM2, PIK3CA, NOTCH2, and NTRK available in basket clinical trials are opportunities for translation of biology into clinical benefit. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '11584964', '_score': 208.25354, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Female [D005260:minor]', 'Risk Factors [D012307:minor]', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative [D013514:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Survival Analysis [D016019:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Palliative Care [D010166:minor]', 'Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]'], 'text': 'Is there a role for incomplete resection in the management of retroperitoneal liposarcomas?\n\n\nComplete surgical resection is the most effective modality for the treatment of retroperitoneal sarcomas. Previous studies of all types of retroperitoneal sarcomas have not shown a survival benefit of incomplete resection over no resection. Because death often occurs as a result of local progression in retroperitoneal liposarcomas (RPLS), it is possible that incomplete resection may be beneficial in this histologic type. In this study we have sought to determine the clinical outcomes in patients with incompletely resected and unresected RPLS with the aim of defining patients who may benefit from palliative resection. From a prospective clinical database 55 patients with incompletely resected (n = 43) or unresected (n = 12) RPLS were identified between 1982 and 1999. Statistical analyses were performed using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier estimates with disease-specific survival as the primary end point. Variables studied included age, gender, recurrent versus primary disease, tumor grade, and tumor size. The patient population consisted of 34 men and 21 women with a mean age of 61 +/- 14 (SD) years. The median time to death was 10 months (range 1 to 83 months) with a median followup of 12 months (range 1 to 60 months) for survivors. Partial resection was an independent factor for increased survival as compared with exploration or biopsy only (median survival 26 versus 4 months, p < 0.0001). Of patients who received incomplete resections, locally recurrent presentation (n = 19) versus primary disease (n = 24) was a negative prognostic variable (median survival 17 versus 46 months, p = 0.009).

Herein, we extend previous findings by quantitatively evaluating the impact of molecular testing of lipomatous neoplasms in our routine clinical practice, how it modifies the historical perspective of their clinical course, and the effect of distinct surgical procedures in modulating the risk of local recurrence for these tumors after molecular classification. On the basis of these analyses, we suggest a specific set of basic recommendations for complementary molecular assessment in the diagnosis of lipomatous tumors. Four hundred and five lipomatous neoplasms located in the trunk and extremities were analyzed histologically and for the presence of 12q13-15 amplification on paraffin-embedded tissues by assessing MDM2/CPM amplification. Survival analyses were calculated with Kaplan-Meier and compared with the log-rank. Multivariate analysis was evaluated by the Cox regression method. The 405 tumors were histologically classified as ordinary lipoma (n=324), intramuscular lipoma (n=29), and ALT/WDL (n=52). The level of agreement between the histologic diagnosis and the molecular diagnosis was high (96%) but pathologists showed a tendency to overestimate cytologic atypia and the diagnosis of ALT/WDL (precision, 79%; accuracy, 88%). Molecular assessment led to a major diagnostic reclassification in 18 tumors (4%). Eleven of the tumors histologically classified as ALT/WDL were reclassified as ordinary lipoma (n=5) and intramuscular lipoma (n=6); none of which recurred. Seven ordinary lipomas were reclassified as ALT/WDL, 6 of which were larger than 15 cm and deeply located; 2 recurred locally. After molecular data, the 5-year local recurrence rates for ordinary lipoma, intramuscular lipoma, and ALT/WDL were 1%, 12%, and 44%, respectively. Multivariate analyses after molecular assessment showed tumor type and type of resection to be associated with the risk of local recurrence. Complementary molecular testing refines the histologic classification of lipomatous tumors and better estimates the impact of surgical procedures on the risk of local recurrence. Pathologists tend to overestimate the degree of cytologic atypia and the indiscriminate use of molecular testing should be avoided, especially for extremity-based tumors. Molecular testing should be considered for "relapsing lipomas," tumors with questionable cytologic atypia (even if widely excised), or for large lipomatous tumors (>15 cm) without diagnostic cytologic atypia.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8387391', '_score': 206.92064, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Gene Expression [D015870:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Genes, p53 [D016158:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C [D008807:minor]', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL [D008810:minor]', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal [D000911:minor]', 'Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:major]', 'Point Mutation [D017354:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]', 'Blotting, Southern [D015139:minor]', 'Cell Division [D002455:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'DNA Probes [D015342:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI [D015246:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Exons [D005091:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]'], 'text': 'p53 Mutation and MDM2 amplification in human soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\nThe p53 and MDM2 genes were analyzed in 24 human soft tissue sarcomas (11 malignant fibrous histiocytomas and 13 liposarcomas).

This class includes the HMGI family members HMGI-C and HMGI(Y). Both are not significantly expressed in differentiated adult tissues, including fat, but their expression is induced in proliferating and transformed cells. Their involvement in the development of lipomatous tumors has been recently demonstrated for HMGI-C, which is encoded by a gene located at 12q15, the chromosomal segment often rearranged in ordinary lipomas. The same chromosomal segment is consistently amplified in the ring and giant marker chromosomes of atypical lipomatous tumors (ALTs), a term used to designate tumors previously labeled as well differentiated liposarcomas or atypical lipomas. The involvement of HMGI(Y) is strongly suspected as the gene coding for HMGI(Y) is located at 6p21, a chromosomal segment rearranged in a subset of ordinary lipomas. HMGI-C or HMGI(Y) protein expression was analyzed immunohistochemically in a group of 39 well differentiated adipose neoplasms (19 lipomas and 20 ALTs) of known karyotype using polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant protein (HMGI-C) and against a synthetic peptide (HMGI(Y)). The results of this study demonstrate that HMGI proteins are commonly expressed in well differentiated adipose neoplasms. Seventeen of twenty ALTS (85.0%), all of which had ring or giant marker chromosomes with amplification of 12q13-15, strongly expressed HMGI-C. HMGI-C expression was detected in 7 of 11 ordinary lipomas (63.6%) with alterations at 12q14-15 and in one case with an abnormal karyotype that included double minute chromosomes. HMGI-C immunoreactivity correlates with 12q13-15 chromosomal alterations (P = 0.001). HMGI(Y) reactivity was demonstrated in only two ordinary lipomas: one with 6p21 rearrangement and one with normal karyotype. No significant HMGI(Y) expression was found in the ALT group. The finding of aberrant expression of HMGI proteins in well differentiated adipose neoplasms in association with 12q13-15 and 6p21 chromosomal changes supports the proposed pathogenetic role of this group of proteins in the development of adipose tissue tumors.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '18269579', '_score': 206.12485, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adipocytes [D017667:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/analysis [Q000032:major]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:major]'], 'text': "Lipoblastoma in adolescents and young adults: report of six cases with FISH analysis.\n\n\nAIMS: Lipoblastoma is a rare benign adipocytic neoplasm that occurs primarily in infancy and early childhood. Histologically, there is some morphological overlap with atypical lipomatous tumour and myxoid liposarcoma and the age at presentation is often regarded as a major diagnostic criterion. However, we recently encountered several cases of lipoblastoma occurring in adolescents and young adults. The aim was to document the occurrence of lipoblastoma in older patients, with cytogenetic confirmation.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Six cases of lipoblastoma in patients >12 years old were identified. The tumours occurred in four male and two female patients ranging from 14 to 24 years old. Our cases showed the classical histological features of lipoblastoma. Three tumours were composed predominantly of mature adipocytes and the three other cases showed an immature appearance, with a prominent myxoid matrix. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated rearrangements of the PLAG1 region in two cases and polysomy for chromosome 8 in three other cases. None of the tumours had amplification of MDM2 or CDK4.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Lipoblastoma occurs rarely in young adults and should enter into the differential diagnosis of 'atypical' fatty tumours in adults.

IRF was extracted from a fresh human colon carcinoma and a liposarcoma using 3 M KCl. These extracts have previously been shown to suppress in vitro human immune responses. Both IRF extracts inhibited PHA-stimulated murine splenocyte [3H]Tdr uptake in a dose-dependent manner while extracts of normal tissue were not inhibitory. To further investigate in vitro immunosuppression a (C57BL/6 X A/J) F1 anti-B10. BR mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was developed. Optimal [3H]Tdr incorporation was on Day 4 with 1 X 10(5) responders and 2 X 10(5) irradiated stimulators. Addition of IRF caused a 56% inhibition of this response but did not alter the kinetics of the MLR response. Induction of cell-mediated cytotoxicity (C57BL/6 X A/J F1 vs B10.D2) was significantly inhibited by addition of IRF during in vitro sensitization. Release of 51Cr from P-815 targets was decreased to spontaneous release levels at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 20:1 when IRF was present during sensitization. At this E:T ratio, cells sensitized in the presence of a normal muscle 3 M KCl extract or medium caused 71 and 60% 51Cr release, respectively.

We wished to address the following questions: (i) Is this genetic hallmark also present in other types of LS with predominant myxoid change? (ii) What is the proportion of cases with the variant EWS-CHOP fusion? (iii) What is the optimal approach for Southern blot detection of TLS breakpoints? We identified 59 LS characterized histologically by >90% myxoid component, in which frozen tissue tumor was available for DNA extraction. These 59 LS with myxoid features were divided into 2 groups: 42 LS with classic myxoid/round cell appearance (myxoid LS) and 17 well-differentiated LS (WDLS) with a predominant (>90%) myxoid component. Within the myxoid LS group, 29 tumors were low grade and 13 high grade (>20% round cell component). Among the 17 predominantly myxoid WDLS, there were 15 low grade and 2 focally high grade tumors. In addition, we selected as control group, 20 LS of other histological types with minimal or no myxoid change (17 WDLS and 3 pleomorphic LS) and 13 myxofibrosarcomas. Southern blot analysis was performed in all cases using a CHOP cDNA probe, and in all CHOP rearranged cases using a TLS cDNA probe. Probe/enzyme combinations for Southern blot analysis were CHOP exon 3-4 cDNA probe with BamHI or SacI, TLS exon 3-6 cDNA probe with BclI. All 42 cases of myxoid LS showed a CHOP rearrangement and 38 of them also had a TLS rearrangement. Among the 4 myxoid LS without Southern blot evidence of TLS rearrangement, 1 showed an EWS-CHOP fusion by Southern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and in another case, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction detected a TLS-CHOP fusion transcript. None of the predominantly myxoid WDLS and none of the tumors included in the control group showed rearranegements with CHOP probe. In addition, 12 predominantly myxoid WDLS, 10 other LS, and 5 myxofibrosarcoma from the control group were also tested for TLS rearrangement; all were negative. The TLS-CHOP fusion is highly sensitive and specific for the entity of classic myxoid/round cell LS. Other types of LS, even with a predominant myxoid component, lack the TLS-CHOP rearrangement, confirming that they represent a genetically distinct group of LS. The prevalence of the EWS-CHOP variant fusion was approximately 2% in this series.

Interestingly, RET and MET activation seems to play a major role in the pathogenesis of MLS by involving different targets through different mechanisms. RET activation (which may activate MET) involves the tumoral vascular component by means of RET/MET cross-talk and VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A)/GFRalpha3 (glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha3)/artemin-mediated signaling as revealed by VEGF receptor 2/RET coimmunoprecipitation. MET activation involves the cellular tumor component by means of a direct ligand-dependent loop and indirect GFRalpha3 (RET coreceptor)/artemin-mediated signaling.

No relevant changes in the original RTK activation profiles were observed in the posttreatment cases, a finding that is in keeping with the nontargeted treatments used.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the particular cell-specific activation profile of RET/GFRalpha3 and MET in MLS, and the close correlation between AKT activation and the round cell variant, thus opening up new therapeutic perspectives for MET/AKT inhibitors and antagonistic small molecules binding GFRalpha3.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '1495946', '_score': 204.25223, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Gene Rearrangement [D015321:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Oncogenes [D009857:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Blotting, Southern [D015139:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'DNA Probes [D015342:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]'], 'text': "Genomic alterations in sarcomas: a histologic correlative study with use of oncogene panels.\n\n\nAmplification and rearrangement of cellular proto-oncogenes are two of the several possible genetic alterations implicated in carcinogenesis and tumor progression.

The oncogene probes utilized were N- and H-ras, sis, EGF-R (erb-B-1), neu (erb-B-2), fos, N- and c-myc, mos, and yes. The tumors studied included: five rhabdomyosarcomas (one alveolar, four embryonal), six malignant fibrous histiocytomas, six leiomyosarcomas, four liposarcomas, two Ewing's sarcomas, one osteosarcoma, and two fibrosarcomas. Oncogene abnormalities were identified in three tumors. One rhabdomyosarcoma showed 12-fold amplification and concurrent rearrangement of sis. This particular tumor also revealed rearrangement of H-ras and 15-fold amplification of c-myc. A second rhabdomyosarcoma revealed rearrangement of neu. A liposarcoma had a sis rearrangement. These findings suggest that many sarcomas show no common structural oncogene abnormalities.

We retrospectively evaluated the safety, feasibility, and general outcome of IBT following cytoreductive surgery.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: After radical resection, the target area to be treated by IBT was determined jointly by the surgeon and the radiation oncologist. A silicon template was used to position parallel hollow catheters spaced 1 cm apart against the area of interest. IBT doses were prescribed at 1 cm depth from the template surface and calculated using standard plans. Radiation was administered in a dedicated shielded room.\n\nRESULTS: Between August 2001 and February 2006, 10 patients (colorectal cancer n = 6, cervix cancer n = 1, extramedullar plasmocytoma n = 1, liposarcoma n = 1 and sacrococcygeal teratocarcinoma n = 1) were treated. The mean delivered IBT dose was 8 Gy (range 7.5-20). No postoperative mortality was seen, while major complications developed in one (10%) patient with a rectovaginal fistula and intraabdominal abscess. Five of the six colorectal cancer patients developed local recurrence while 3 also developed distant metastases. The mean disease-free and overall survival in this group was 8.5 months (range 4-15) and 25.5 months (range 10-48) respectively. Palliation of symptoms was observed in 89 % of cases.\n\nCONCLUSION: IBT combined with debulking surgery is feasible and can be safely performed. While cure is rarely achieved, IBT offers the potential to prolong local control and survival in locally unresectable intraabdominal cancer. Therefore, IBT can be considered as a valuable adjuvant in the therapeutic and palliative armamentarium in these selected patients.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20376344', '_score': 203.9187, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Molecular Mimicry [D018716:minor]', 'Neoplasms [D009369:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic [D009389:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:major]', 'Peptides [D010455:minor]/chemical synthesis [Q000138:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A [D042461:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/chemical synthesis [Q000138:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Binding Sites [D001665:minor]', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung [D018827:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]', 'Cell Proliferation [D049109:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Disease Models, Animal [D004195:minor]', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans [D019812:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]'], 'text': 'HSPG-binding peptide corresponding to the exon 6a-encoded domain of VEGF inhibits tumor growth by blocking angiogenesis in murine model.\n\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor VEGF(165) is a critical element for development of the vascular system in physiological and pathological angiogenesis.

We performed a study to evaluate the long-term clinical behavior and proper treatment and follow-up strategy for these tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the files of 101 patients treated between 1990 and 2008 with the diagnosis of atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas. For 67 of these patients, complete data and 2-year minimum follow-up were available and were included in the study; 47 patients (group A) had primary surgical treatment at our institution and 20 patients (group B) were referred after ≥1 local recurrences. Mean follow-up was 81 months (range, 24-229 months). The local recurrence rate of primary atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas was 10.6% (5/47 group A patients). The local re-recurrence rate of the recurrent atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated liposarcomas was 52% (13/67 group A and B patients).

A case report of G-CSF-producing soft-tissue tumors, possible association with undifferentiated liposarcoma lineage.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) functions as a hematopoietic growth factor and it is responsible for leukocytosis. G-CSF-producing tumors associated with leukocytosis include various types of malignancies.\n\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 72-year-old man with dedifferentiated liposarcoma characterized by dedifferentiated components of malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)-like features in addition to well-differentiated lipoma-like liposarcoma, arising from his upper arm. Preoperative laboratory data showed leukocytosis (103,700/mul). The serum level of G-CSF was also elevated (620 pg/ml [normal, <8 pg/ml]). Nine days after the surgery, the leukocytosis was relieved (WBC; 6,920/mul) and the elevated serum G-CSF level was significantly decreased (G-CSF; 12 pg/ml). One month after the surgery, leukocytosis gradually began to appear again. Three months after the surgery metastatic lung lesions were confirmed, and the patient subsequently died of respiratory problems. In the English literature regarding soft-tissue tumors with leukocytosis, including the current case, we could review a total of 6 cases of liposarcoma with leukocytosis. The subtype of these 6 liposarcoma cases was undifferentiated liposarcoma, comprising dedifferentiated liposarcoma in 4 cases and pleomorphic liposarcoma in 2 cases.\n\nCONCLUSION: Since the only other soft-tissue tumor that was associated with leukocytosis was MFH, and since MFH is characterized by the absence of any specific differentiation, we would like to propose a possible association between G-CSF-producing soft-tissue tumors and an undifferentiated liposarcoma lineage, such as dedifferentiated liposarcoma or pleomorphic liposarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_134972-144', '_score': 201.0152, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: Diversity and heterogeneity in molecular analysis of advanced sarcomas: The clinical, regulatory, and financial challenge for drug development and precision medicine.\n\n\n\nBackground:   Therapeutic options are limited for advanced sarcomas. Search for molecular alterations could lead to identification of novel therapies for refractory sarcoma patients. Rarity poses an extreme challenge in drug development.  Methods:  We reviewed the charts of patients with advanced sarcoma patients who were referred to the phase 1 clinic at MD Anderson Cancer center and had molecular profiling done by commercially available CLIA certified labs. We analyzed the preliminary responses to matched therapy in these patients.  Results:  Among the 57 pts analyzed, median age =48 years (M: F=25:32), median ECOG PS=1, median no. of prior therapies=3. Most common subtypes were leiomyosarcoma (n=13; 22%), rhabdomyosarcoma (n=8; 14 %), liposarcoma (n=7; 12 %), osteosarcoma (n=7; 12 %), clear cell sarcoma (n=3), and synovial sarcoma (n=3). Forty-five/57 (78%) patients had > 1 genomic aberration.  Each pts aberration profile was distinct. For instance, in osteosarcoma no 2 ps had the same profile. In other soft tissue sarcomas, aberrations involved CDKN2A/B loss or mutation (n=10; 22 %), TP53 alterations (n=15; 33%), CDK4 amplification (n=8; 17%), MDM2 amplification (n=7; 15%), and RB1 loss/mutation (n=6; 13%). In addition, novel aberrations: KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein in a spindle cell sarcoma, CD30 + in osteosarcoma, and PTPRD mutation in Ewings sarcoma were identified. Molecularly matched therapy are ongoing (Table ).  Conclusions:  Based on the uniqueness and distinct biology of sarcoma, we conclude that the established model for drug development in sarcoma of one size fits all approach does not fit the reality of sarcoma biology. New creative models for precision medicine with regulatory approval, establishment of levels of evidence, modification of reimbursement policies by health care payers and innovative dynamic ways to collect N of 1 clinical data in real time with open access are warranted.  \n Diagnosis\nAberration\nMatched therapy\nResponse\n\n\n\n RMS\nPIK3CA\nPI3K inhibitor\nSD(18 weeks)\n\n Spindle cell sarcoma\nKIAA1549-BRAF PTEN loss\nRAF+mTOR\nSD(26% decrease)(16 weeks)\n\n LMS\nPTEN loss\nVEGF +mTOR\nSD(16 weeks)\n\n LMS\nPIK3R1\nmTOR+HDAC\nSD(15 weeks)\n\n\n\n\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '9046316', '_score': 199.87943, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Biopsy [D001706:minor]', 'Hematoma, Subdural [D006408:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Infant [D007223:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging [D008279:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Meningeal Neoplasms [D008577:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri [D011559:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Suction [D013396:minor]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Chronic Disease [D002908:minor]', 'Craniotomy [D003399:minor]', 'Diagnosis, Differential [D003937:minor]', 'Dura Mater [D004388:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Fibrosarcoma [D005354:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]'], 'text': 'Subdural sarcoma associated with chronic subdural hematoma.

Liposarcoma is the second most common soft tissue sarcoma affecting predominantly the retroperitoneal space and extremities. Mesenteric liposarcoma is uncommon and occurs in the small bowel mesentery. In this paper we report the case of a recurrent mesocolon myxoid liposarcoma manifesting 6 years from the initial right hemicolectomy for the primary tumour. Case Report. A 41-year-old female presented with a 4-day history of signs and symptoms indicative of small bowel obstruction, subsequently confirmed on plain abdominal X-ray. In 2006 she underwent a right hemicolectomy for a myxoid liposarcoma of the mesentery. The patient was initially managed conservatively; however she showed no signs of improvement and was taken to theatre for an exploratory laparotomy and division of adhesional bands. During this procedure an incidental finding of a dark purple, smooth pelvic mass was identified with similar macroscopic appearance to that of splenic tissue. Histological examination revealed a recurrent mesocolon myxoid liposarcoma. Conclusion. Mesocolon myxoid liposarcoma is a rare soft tissue neoplastic pathology and carries a high risk of recurrence.

MDM2 was amplified in 9 of the tumors, SAS in 10, GADD153 in 4, GLI in 2, and A2MR in 2. Amplification was, in most cases, associated with increased expression of the corresponding gene. SAS and MDM2 were coamplified in 8 of the tumors, whereas GADD153, GLI, and A2MR were only amplified together with SAS. One liposarcoma showed amplification of MDM2 alone, whereas two osteosarcomas and a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line showed amplification of SAS and GADD153 (CHOP) but not MDM2.

Given the emerging role of signal transduction in these syndromes, we set out to explore the possible role that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), first identified as a G protein-coupled receptor regulator, could have as a modulator of insulin responses.\n\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the influence of GRK2 levels in insulin signaling in myoblasts and adipocytes with experimentally increased or silenced levels of GRK2, as well as in GRK2 hemizygous animals expressing 50% lower levels of this kinase in three different models of insulin resistance: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) infusion, aging, and high-fat diet (HFD). Glucose transport, whole-body glucose and insulin tolerance, the activation status of insulin pathway components, and the circulating levels of important mediators were measured. The development of obesity and adipocyte size with age and HFD was analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Altering GRK2 levels markedly modifies insulin-mediated signaling in cultured adipocytes and myocytes. GRK2 levels are increased by ∼2-fold in muscle and adipose tissue in the animal models tested, as well as in lymphocytes from metabolic syndrome patients. In contrast, hemizygous GRK2 mice show enhanced insulin sensitivity and do not develop insulin resistance by TNF-α, aging, or HFD. Furthermore, reduced GRK2 levels induce a lean phenotype and decrease age-related adiposity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data identify GRK2 as an important negative regulator of insulin effects, key to the etiopathogenesis of insulin resistance and obesity, which uncovers this protein as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of these disorders.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '16353021', '_score': 197.31618, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Thoracic Neoplasms [D013899:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Thoracic Surgical Procedures [D019616:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Hemangiosarcoma [D006394:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness [D009361:minor]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]'], 'text': '[Diagnosis and results of surgical treatment of rare giant intrathoracic tumors].\n\n\nSurgical treatment was performed in 19 patients aged 30 to 64 years with rare giant intrathoracic tumors.

We determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in soft tissue sarcomas of 341 patients comprising 16 entities and in 16 sarcoma cell lines covering 7 different soft tissue sarcoma types.\n\nMETHODS: The sarcoma tissue samples were collected from the archives of the Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg and were composed of 39 myxoid liposarcomas (MLS), 61 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 15 pleomorphic liposarcomas, 27 leiomyosarcomas, 25 synovial sarcomas (SS), 35 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), 40 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 17 myxofibrosarcomas, 9 low grade fibromyxoid sarcomas, 10 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 31 solitary fibrous tumors (SFT), 8 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 9 angiosarcomas, 6 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 5 clear cell sarcomas and 4 epithelioid sarcomas.

Nutlin-3, a small-molecule antagonist of MDM2, inhibits proliferation in cancer cells with wild-type p53 by blocking the interaction of MDM2 and p53. However, different cancer cells differ greatly sensitivity of Nutlin-3 because of MDM2 amplification and/or p53 mutation status. Herein, we evaluate the sensitivity of Nutlin-3 in different cancer cell lines including four mesothelioma cell lines, one breast cancer line, and one leiomyosarcoma cell line with nonmutant p53 expression, two liposarcoma cell lines harboring MDM2 amplification and wild-type p53, and one control mesothelioma cell line JMN1B harboring p53 point mutation. Unexpectedly, Nutlin-3 treatment induced cyclin D1 expression accompanied with inhibition of MDM2-p53 interaction in nonmutant cancer cell lines. Additive effects were obtained through a coordinated attack on MDM2-p53 interaction and cyclin D1, as demonstrated by immunoblots, cell viability and cell cycle analyses, showing that lentiviral mediated cyclin D1 knockdown or drug inhibition, and block of MDM2-p53 interaction, in cancer cell lines containing wild-type p53, induced greater anti-proliferative effects, compared to either intervention alone. Further results demonstrated that upregulation of cyclin D1 after Nutlin-3 treatment to some extent was dependent on expression and ubiquitin E3-ligase activity of MDM2. These compelling anti-proliferative responses indicate that combination inhibition of cyclin D1 and MDM2-p53 interaction warrants clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic strategy in cancer cells harboring wild-type p53.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8134123', '_score': 194.12216, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]', 'Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]', 'Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Restriction Mapping [D015183:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid [D017386:minor]', 'Tetraspanins [D059470:minor]', 'Base Sequence [D001483:minor]', 'Blotting, Northern [D015152:minor]', 'Cells, Cultured [D002478:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12 [D002881:minor]', 'Consensus Sequence [D016384:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Membrane Proteins [D008565:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]'], 'text': 'SAS, a gene amplified in human sarcomas, encodes a new member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily of proteins.\n\n\nAmplification of 12q13-14 occurs in a subset of human sarcomas including malignant fibrous histiocytoma and liposarcoma.

Among these subtypes is malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), a diagnosis no longer recognized as a specific diagnosis at some institutions. In this study, gene expression in 38 histologically well-defined sarcoma samples, 17 MFH samples, 12 samples of sarcomas classified simply as high-grade sarcoma (NOS, standing for "not otherwise specified"), and 26 other mesenchymal tumors was determined at Gene Logic Inc (Gaithersburg, MD), with the use of Affymetrix GeneChip U_133 arrays containing approximately 40,000 known genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Gene-expression analysis was performed with the use of the Gene Logic Gene Express(R) Software System. Differences in gene expression were quantified as the fold change in gene expression between the various sets of well-defined sarcomas. A set of genes was then identified that could be used to distinguish the well-defined sets of 11 liposarcomas, 9 leiomyosarcomas, 4 synovial sarcomas, 8 schwannomas, and 12 cases of aggressive fibromatosis through the use of Eisen clustering. Eisen clustering was then repeated with the same set of gene fragments with the sample set of 38 histologically well-defined sarcomas, the 17 sarcomas classified as MFH, 12 sarcomas classified as high-grade sarcoma (NOS), and 26 other mesenchymal tumors. Under these conditions, each of the samples of well-defined sarcoma formed distinct clusters that contained some of the MFH and NOS samples. In addition, distinct clusters were observed that contained only MFH and NOS samples.

In spite of improvement of the diagnostic facilities and surgical techniques, quite frequently local recurrences with unfavourable prognosis turn up even after complete removal. It was the aim of this study to analyze diagnosis, therapy and long-term prognosis in patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas over a period of 10 years.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1995 and January 2005, 379 patients underwent surgery for a primary retroperitoneal tumor at our clinic. Among the 67 (17.1 %) malignant lesions, a sarcoma was found in 35 patients. The present study is focused on the long-term prognosis of those 21 patients with a primary resected retroperitoneal sarcoma, recurrent sarcomas and exploratory laparotomies excluded.\n\nRESULTS: The median patient age at the time of surgery was 61 (25-86) years, 57.1 % were males. The duration of symptoms was 3 (1-36) months. A pR0-resection was achieved in 20/21 patients. Among the histopathological tumor types, liposarcomas (n = 10) and leiomyosarcomas (n = 6) were found most frequently. Local recurrence developed in 12 out of 21 patients at 13.5 (5-42) months after the first operation, and in 4 patients distant metastases were observed. The long-term survival of all 21 patients with primary resected retroperitoneal sarcoma was 24 (1-101) months. A more favourable prognosis was seen in patients with leiomyosarcoma as compared with liposarcoma.\n\nCONCLUSION: Retroperitoneal sarcomas are a heterogeneous entity, and they were found among our own patients in 6.1 % of all primary operatively treated retroperitoneal tumors. The strategy of treatment is complex and dependent on the stage, localization and histopathological characteristics. Long-term survival is limited as a result of the high rate of local recurrence.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19276386', '_score': 192.64453, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'Muscle, Smooth [D009130:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'RNA, Small Interfering [D034741:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Trans-Activators [D015534:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Up-Regulation [D015854:minor]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Movement [D002465:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17 [D002886:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]', 'Gene Silencing [D020868:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': 'Strong smooth muscle differentiation is dependent on myocardin gene amplification in most human retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas.\n\n\nMyocardin (MYOCD), a serum response factor (SRF) transcriptional cofactor, is essential for cardiac and smooth muscle development and differentiation. We show here by array-based comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and expression analysis approaches that MYOCD gene is highly amplified and overexpressed in human retroperitoneal leiomyosarcomas (LMS), a very aggressive well-differentiated tumor. MYOCD inactivation by shRNA in a human LMS cell line with MYOCD locus amplification leads to a dramatic decrease of smooth muscle differentiation and strongly reduces cell migration. Moreover, forced MYOCD expression in three undifferentiated sarcoma cell lines and in one liposarcoma cell line confers a strong smooth muscle differentiation phenotype and increased migration abilities. Collectively, these results show that human retroperitoneal LMS differentiation is dependent on MYOCD amplification/overexpression, suggesting that in these well-differentiated LMS, differentiation could be a consequence of an acquired genomic alteration. In this hypothesis, these tumors would not necessarily derive from cells initially committed to smooth muscle differentiation. These data also provide new insights on the cellular origin of these sarcomas and on the complex connections between oncogenesis and differentiation in mesenchymal tumors.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25683346', '_score': 192.0931, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques [D007124:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Metastasis [D009362:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Neoplasm Proteins [D009363:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational [D011499:major]', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases [D020794:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/enzymology [Q000201:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/secondary [Q000556:minor]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic [D015971:minor]'], 'text': 'Anaplastic lymphoma kinase protein expression, genetic abnormalities, and phosphorylation in soft tissue tumors: Phosphorylation is associated with recurrent metastasis.\n\n\nGene and protein abnormalities of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) play an important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers and serve as important therapeutic targets.

They are easily released from plastics into the environment and can be found in measurable levels in human fluids. Phthalates are agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), through which they regulate translocator protein (TSPO; 18 kDa) transcription in a tissue-specific manner. TSPO is a drug- and cholesterol-binding protein involved in mitochondrial respiration, steroid formation, and cell proliferation. TSPO has been shown to increase during differentiation and decrease during maturation in mouse adipocytes. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) on the differentiation of human SW 872 preadipocyte cells, and examine the role of TSPO in the process. After 4 days of treatment with 10 µM MEHP, we observed changes in the transcription of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, glucose transporters 1 and 4, and the S100 calcium binding protein B, all of which are markers of preadipocyte differentiation. These observed gene expression changes coincided with a decrease in cellular proliferation without affecting cellular triglyceride content. Taken together, these data suggest that MEHP exerts a differentiating effect on human preadipocytes. Interestingly, MEHP was able to temporarily increase TSPO mRNA levels through the PPAR-α and β/δ pathways. These results suggest that TSPO can be considered an important player in the differentiation process itself, or alternatively a factor whose presence is essential for adipocyte development.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '12494468', '_score': 191.44548, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Karyotyping [D007621:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Translocation, Genetic [D014178:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Angiolipoma [D018206:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Chromosome Deletion [D002872:major]', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast [D018244:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13 [D002882:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'DNA Probes [D015342:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]'], 'text': 'Clustering of deletions on chromosome 13 in benign and low-malignant lipomatous tumors.\n\n\nDeletions and structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 13 are frequently observed in benign and low-malignant lipomatous tumors, but nothing is known about their molecular genetic consequences.

It represents approximately 20 % of all mesenchymal malignancies. It most frequently involves retroperitoneum, trunk, and extremities. Hypopharyngeal and esophageal localization of liposarcoma is extremely rare.\n\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic review of literature and reported 26 and 33 cases of hypopharyngeal and esophageal liposarcoma. We analyzed natural history, imaging features, histology, treatment, and prognosis, with a specific focus to similarities and differences between tumors of hypopharynx and esophagus.\n\nRESULTS: Hypopharyngeal and esophageal liposarcomas have more similarities than differences. Incidence has a peak at 6th and 7th decades. The diagnostic procedures are barium swallow, endoscopic examination, and CT/MR imaging. Well-differentiated liposarcoma represents the most frequent histological subtype. Surgical excision is the main treatment. Endoscopic resection can be useful for pedunculated tumors of hypopharynx and cervical esophagus. Differences between hypopharyngeal and esophageal liposarcoma are represented by local recurrence rate (greater for hypopharyngeal tumors), number of giant tumors, and time to recurrence (greater for esophageal tumors). Finally, liposarcomas of distal esophagus need more extended approaches.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Liposarcomas of hypopharynx and cervical esophagus could be considered a unique pathological entity, with similar features and treatment options. Survival rate is dependent on histological type and location. Local recurrence is common, especially for hypopharyngeal liposarcoma, while the risk of lymph node or distant metastasis is very low.

Local recurrence after surgical resection is reported between 60% and 90% at 10 yr. The aim of this study was to present the problem of satellite tumors around the main tumor mass and their possible relation to local recurrence.\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-nine patients with retroperitoneal tumors underwent surgical resection in our department during an 8-yr period. We reviewed their records including their preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\nRESULTS: Twenty patients had "complete" resections requiring seven nephrectomies, four colectomies, two splenectomies, and one appendectomy. In nine cases the resection was incomplete because of tumor invasion to vital structures. Histopathology revealed that the resected tumors were: liposarcomas (12), leiomyosarcomas (4), paragangliomas (5), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (3), other sarcomas (3), schwannoma (1), myelolipoma (1), and the malignancy grade was I in 6, grade II in 11, and grade III in 12 cases. Two patients died within 30 d of the operation. The I year recurrence rate was 41.4% (12/29) and the total recurrence rate 55.2% (16/29). Survival at 5 yr was 31% (9/29), whereas the disease-free survival was 20.7% (6/29). Four patients required reoperations. In seven cases (24,1%) preoperative CT scans revealed small nodular lesions around the main tumor that were removed en bloc and were of the same histopathological type as the main tumor. We called these "satellite" tumors. All seven patients had local recurrence within 1 yr.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There seems to be a close relationship between the finding of satellite tumors and the recurrence of the disease. The existence of satellite tumors on the preoperative CT scan may be used as a guide for the extent of the resection, and further investigations are necessary before they are used as a prognostic sign.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22911243', '_score': 188.5201, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Characterization of liposarcoma cell lines for preclinical and biological studies.\n\n\nLiposarcoma cell lines represent in vitro models for studying disease mechanisms at the cellular level and for preclinical evaluation of novel drugs.

Furthermore, staging examinations did not reveal indications of any other primary tumors.

The lesion has a characteristic AHRR-NCOA2 fusion gene derived from chromosomal translocation of t(5;8)(p15;q13).

We also performed FISH for 13q14 deletion and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, retinoblastoma protein, and MUC-4 expression. Furthermore, IHC for Stat6 was conducted in the 20 cases analyzed by FISH and in an additional 26 SFTs. We found moderate to strong nuclear Stat6 expression in all SFTs but no expression in the other tumors. Both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor expressions were observed in STAs, SFTs, and cellular angiofibromas. Expression of retinoblastoma protein was found in less than 10% of cells in all tumor types except myxoid liposarcoma. The low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas were strongly positive for MUC-4. All STAs showed NCOA2 split signals on FISH. All tumors, regardless of histologic type, had 13q14 deletion. The NCOA2 FISH technique is a practical method for confirming STA diagnosis.

Objective.-To analyze beta-catenin mutation and accumulation in a series of liposarcomas and malignant fibrous histiocytomas.\n\nDESIGN: beta-Catenin mutation in exon 3 was studied using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing analysis in 30 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded liposarcomas. The tumors included 12 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, characterized by both high-grade anaplastic components and well-differentiated liposarcoma components, plus 18 well-differentiated liposarcomas (10 lipoma-like and 8 sclerosing-type cases). The 2 components of dedifferentiated liposarcomas were analyzed independently. beta-Catenin accumulation in the nuclei or cytoplasm and Ki-67 expression (cell-proliferation marker, MIB-1 labeling index) were examined immunohistochemically. Nine storiform-pleomorphic-type malignant fibrous histiocytomas were also studied.\n\nRESULTS: Dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed mutation in 2 cases (17%) and accumulation in 5 cases (42%). One of the 2 cases that showed mutations had a mutation in the well-differentiated component; this mutation was silent. The other case had mutations that differed between the 2 components. In well-differentiated liposarcomas, mutation was not seen in any of the cases (0/18; 0%); however, accumulation was seen frequently in the sclerosing-type cases (5/8; 63%), but not in the lipoma-like cases (0/10; 0%). Malignant fibrous histiocytomas showed mutation and accumulation in 5 (56%) and 4 (44%) cases, respectively, without any exact correlation between the cases. Cases with accumulation had a higher MIB-1 labeling index than those without, among both the sclerosing-type well-differentiated liposarcomas (P <.05) and the malignant fibrous histiocytomas.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the possible involvement of beta-catenin activation caused by beta-catenin mutation in liposarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, but the contribution would seem to be different, depending on the tumor type. beta-Catenin accumulation is also thought to be related to cell proliferation in some of the cases.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '21739209', '_score': 186.08046, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Interdisciplinary Communication [D033183:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Limb Salvage [D023821:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Grading [D060787:minor]', 'Patient Care Team [D010348:minor]', 'Postoperative Complications [D011183:minor]/psychology [Q000523:major]', 'Quality of Life [D011788:minor]/psychology [Q000523:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Survivors [D017741:minor]', 'Cooperative Behavior [D003299:minor]', 'Extremities [D005121:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Fascia [D005205:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Fasciotomy [D000071938:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Malignant Fibrous [D051677:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Compartmental resection for subfascial extremity soft tissue sarcoma and quality of life in long-term survivors.\n\n\nThe surgical management of soft tissue sarcoma has changed over the past years, resulting in an interdisciplinary multimodal approach and limb-preserving treatment modalities.

The assessment of MDM2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has become a routine ancillary tool for diagnosing atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT)/well-differentiated liposarcoma and dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDL/DDL) in specialist sarcoma units. We describe our experience of its utility at our tertiary institute. Methods. All routine histology samples in which MDM2 amplification was assessed with FISH over a 2-year period were included, and FISH results were correlated with clinical and histologic findings. Results. 365 samples from 347 patients had FISH for MDM2 gene amplification. 170 were positive (i.e., showed MDM2 gene amplification), 192 were negative, and 3 were technically unsatisfactory. There were 122 histologically benign cases showing a histology:FISH concordance rate of 92.6%, 142 WDL/DDL (concordance 96.5%), and 34 cases histologically equivocal for WDL (concordance 50%). Of 64 spindle cell/pleomorphic neoplasms (in which DDL was a differential diagnosis), 21.9% showed MDM2 amplification. Of the cases with discrepant histology and FISH, all but 3 had diagnoses amended following FISH results. For discrepancies of benign histology but positive FISH, lesions were on average larger, more frequently in "classical" (intra-abdominal or inguinal) sites for WDL/DDL and more frequently core biopsies. Discrepancies of malignant histology but negative FISH were smaller, less frequently in "classical" sites but again more frequently core biopsies. Conclusions. FISH has a high correlation rate with histology for cases with firm histologic diagnoses of lipoma or WDL/DDL. It is a useful ancillary diagnostic tool in histologically equivocal cases, particularly in WDL lacking significant histologic atypia or DDL without corresponding WDL component, especially in larger tumors, those from intra-abdominal or inguinal sites or core biopsies.

However, the relation between PBL telomere length and the risk of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) has not been investigated.\n\nMETHODS: The relative telomere length (RTL) was determined in PBLs using real-time polymerase chain reaction in this case-control study. The study participants included 137 patients with histologically confirmed STS (cases) who had received no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy and 137 healthy controls who were frequency-matched to cases on age, sex, and ethnicity.\n\nRESULTS: Patients in the case group had significantly longer RTL than controls (1.46 ± 0.42 for cases vs 1.15 ± 0.39 for controls; P < .001).

When participants were categorized further into 3 or 4 groups according to the tertile or quartile RTL values of healthy controls, a significant dose-response relation was observed between longer RTL and increased risks of STS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The current results provided the first epidemiologic evidence that longer telomere length in PBLs is associated significantly with an increased risk of STS, potentially suggesting an important role for telomere maintenance in STS development.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '10993610', '_score': 180.45377, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Reoperation [D012086:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Biology [D001695:minor]', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant [D017024:minor]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas: prognosis and treatment of primary and recurrent disease.\n\n\nSoft-tissue sarcomas of the retroperitoneum constitute a heterogeneous group of tumors with varying histology, potential for complete resection, and propensity for recurrent disease-making the development of effective treatment difficult and challenging. A retrospective review of 23 patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas from 1985 through 1998 was performed to assess the biological behavior and clinical outcomes and to identify factors that may influence prognosis and optimize treatment strategy.

Low-grade tumors independent of histologic type exhibited good prognosis for long-term survival with a median survival of 44 months. In contrast, intermediate- or high-grade tumors were associated with a median survival of only 9 months (P < 0.02).

Its role in the evaluation of spindle cell and mesenchymal lesions of the breast, which include a variety of benign and malignant conditions, is less clear. This article discusses the cytologic features and differential diagnosis of these lesions, as well as the potential diagnostic pitfalls associated with them.\n\nMETHODS: FNAs of the breast, in which a spindle cell or mesenchymal component was a key or dominant feature, were retrieved. Fibroadenomas without cellular stroma and typical lipomas were excluded.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-six aspirates (0.87%) in a series of 5306 breast FNAs contained a significant spindle cell or mesenchymal component. The aspirates were classified into 4 categories: 1) reactive conditions, including 2 diabetic mastopathies, 3 granulation tissue specimens, and 7 granulomatous lesions; 2) benign neoplastic conditions, including 1 mammary hamartoma, 1 dermatofibroma, 1 fibromatosis, 2 granular cell tumors, 2 angiolipomas, and 7 cellular fibroadenomas; 3) low grade malignant neoplastic lesions, including 10 low grade phyllodes tumors; and 4) high grade malignant neoplastic lesions, including 1 metaplastic carcinoma with chondroid stroma, 1 pleomorphic liposarcoma, 2 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 2 osteosarcomas, and 4 metastatic melanomas. A specific diagnosis was rendered in 38 cases (82.6%). The mammary hamartoma was diagnosed as fibrocystic changes; the dermatofibroma as benign spindle cell lesion, not otherwise specified (NOS); and the primary osteosarcoma as an atypical spindle cell proliferation, NOS. The reactive ductal epithelial cells in one of the granulomatous mastitis specimens, as well as the hyperplastic ductal epithelial cells in one of the phyllodes tumors, were interpreted as atypical ductal proliferation. The marked cytologic atypia displayed by one granular cell tumor was interpreted as low grade adenocarcinoma and the primary liposarcoma as poorly differentiated carcinoma.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Breast lesions with a significant spindle cell or mesenchymal component are rarely encountered in FNA and constitute a heterogeneous group that may pose a diagnostic dilemma. FNA should be the initial diagnostic procedure for investigating these lesions, as a specific diagnosis was rendered in the majority of cases.

The SMF-A cell line was established from a metastatic nodule of an induced rhabdomyosarcoma in syngeneic F344 rats. Two cell lines with defined metastatic potentials, SMF-Ai and SMF-Da, were cloned from the SMF-A line. The cell line SMF-Ai is tumorigenic, highly invasive and highly metastatic. On the other hand, the revertant line SMF-Da is less tumorigenic, non-invasive and non-metastatic. We have isolated from a SMF-Ai cDNA library eight cDNA clones which are differentially expressed by the metastatic SMF-Ai and the non-metastatic SMF-Da cell line using Northern blot analysis. Five of these clones, smf-4, smf-6, smf-41, smf-42 and smf-44, are overexpressed in the SMF-Da cell line and have homology with beta-2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, ribosomal protein L38, ribosomal protein S4 and acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P1, respectively. The three other clones, smf-7, smf-40 and smf-61, are overexpressed in SMF-Ai. Clones smf-40 and smf-61 show significant homology with the human TB3-1 gene and the human fus gene respectively. The clone smf-7 has no significant homology with known sequences. We also analyzed the expression of these clones in other rat rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines (RMS-B and their clones) and in tumors obtained by injection of these cell lines into rats or nude mice. Smf-61 and smf-7 were the only clones with a differential expression pattern associated with the invasive or metastatic potential of all cell lines examined. A preliminary study of the expression of smf-7 and smf-61 in other cancer cell lines also showed mRNA expression in two human rhabdomyosarcomas and a human epidermoid carcinoma suggesting the existence of genes homologous to smf-7 and smf-61 clones in human cancers.

Treatment with RET specific kinase inhibitor Vandetanib failed to reduce RET phosphorylation and inhibit cell growth, suggesting that other RTKs may phosphorylate RET. A screening pointed out EGFR and ERBB3 as the strongest expressed phosphorylated RTKs in MLS cells. We show that ERBB3 formed nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes with RET and both RTKs were previously reported to form complexes with EGFR. The formation of RTK hetero complexes could explain the observed Vandetanib resistence in MLS. EGFR and ERBB3 are clients of HSP90 that help complex formation and RTK activation. Treatment of cultured MLS cells with HSP90 inhibitor 17-DMAG, caused loss of RET and ERBB3 phosphorylation and lead to rapid cell death. Treatment of MLS xenograft carrying Nude mice resulted in massive necrosis, rupture of capillaries and hemorrhages in tumor tissues. We conclude that complex formation between RET and other RTKs may cause RTK inhibitor resistance. HSP90 inhibitors can overcome this resistance and are thus promising drugs for treatment of MLS/RCLS.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '222115', '_score': 179.45847, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Hemangioma [D006391:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Hemangiopericytoma [D006393:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Hemangiosarcoma [D006394:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Infant [D007223:minor]', 'Leiomyoma [D007889:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Lipoma [D008067:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Lymphangioma [D008202:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neurilemmoma [D009442:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Neurofibroma [D009455:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms [D010524:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma [D012208:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Chordoma [D002817:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Fibroma [D005350:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms [D006258:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': 'A clinicopathological study on soft tissue tumors of the head and neck.\n\n\nThe present study consists of 651 cases of soft tissue tumors originating in the head and neck area.

Pazopanib (PAZ) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of non-adipocytic advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The activity of this agent has not yet been properly explored in preclinical liposarcoma models nor in a randomized phase Ш clinical trial in this entity. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PAZ had antitumor activity in DDLPS models in vivo.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We established two patient-derived DDLPS xenograft models (UZLX-STS3 and UZLX-STS5) through implantation of tumor material from sarcoma patients in athymic nude NMRI mice. An animal model of the SW872 liposarcoma cell line was also used. To investigate the efficacy of PAZ in vivo, mice bearing tumors were treated for 2 weeks with sterile water, doxorubicin (1.2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice per week), PAZ [40 mg/kg, orally (p.o.), twice per day], or PAZ plus doxorubicin (same schedules as for single treatments).\n\nRESULTS: Patient-derived xenografts retained the histologic and molecular features of DDLPS. PAZ significantly delayed tumor growth by decreasing proliferation and inhibited angiogenesis in all models tested.

Many protein-coding genes in the region, such as MDM2 and CDK4, have been studied as potential therapeutic targets for LPS treatment with minimal success. Within this amplicon near the MDM2 gene, our SNP array analysis identified frequent amplification of miR-26a-2. Besides being in the amplicon, we found that miR-26a-2 is overexpressed significantly in WDLPS/DDLPS, as well as in myxoid/round cell LPS (MRC). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overexpression of miR-26a-2 significantly correlated with poor patient survival in both types of LPS.Based on these findings, we hypothesized that miR-26a-2 plays an important role in LPS tumorigenesis, regardless of LPS subtypes. Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells could help the growth and survival of cancer cells in a cell type-specific manner, including faster cell proliferation, faster cell migration, enhanced clonogenicity, suppressed adipocyte differentiation, and/or resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells using anti-miR-26a-2 resulted in the opposite responses.To explain further the effect of miR-26a-2 overexpression in LPS cells, we performed in sillico analysis and identified 93 candidate targets of miR-26a-2. Among these candidate genes, we found that RCBTB1 (RCC1 and BTB domain containing protein 1) was located at 13q12.3-q14.3, a recurrent region of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in human LPS. Indeed, overexpression of RCBTB1 made cells more susceptible to apoptosis. Likewise, inhibition of RCBTB1 made cells more resistant to apoptosis.In conclusion, our study reveals, for the first time, the contribution that miR-26a-2 makes to LPS tumorigenesis, partly through inhibiting RCBTB1. Our study shows that miR-26a-2 is a novel therapeutic target for human LPS.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27499897', '_score': 175.89967, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': "Clinical outcome in patients with peripherally-sited atypical lipomatous tumours and dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\n\nThe reported incidence of local recurrence of peripheral atypical lipomatous tumours is highly variable and is likely to reflect the different inclusion criteria of cases, and the design of previous studies.

The cumulative multicenter European experience.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to achieve limb salvage in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas that can only be treated by amputation or functionally mutilating surgery by performing an isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) + melphalan (M) as induction biochemotherapy to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery possible.\n\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced extremity soft tissue sarcoma, preoperative radiation therapy or chemotherapy or a combination of the two often are applied. The ILP with cytostatic agents alone is another option but rarely is used because of rather poor results. The efficacy of the application of TNF in ILP markedly has changed this situation.\n\nMETHODS: In 8 cancer centers, 186 patients were treated over a period of almost 4.5 years. There were 107 (57%) primary and 79 (43%) recurrent sarcomas, mostly high grade (110 grade III; 51 grade II; and 25 very large, recurrent, or multiple grade I sarcomas). The composition of this series of patients is unusual: 42 patients (23%) had multifocal primary or multiple recurrent tumors; median tumor size was very large (16 cm); 25 patients (13%) had known systemic metastases at the time of the ILP. Patients underwent a 90-minute ILP at 39 to 40 C with TNF + melphalan. The first 55 patients also received interferon-tau. A delayed marginal resection of the tumor remnant was done 2 to 4 months after ILP.\n\nRESULTS: A major tumor response was seen in 82% of the patients rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. Clinical response rates were: 33 complete response (CR) (18%), 106 partial response (PR) (57%), 42 no change (NC) (22%), and 5 progressive disease (PD) (3%). Final outcome was defined by clinical and pathologic response: 54 CR (29%), 99 PR (53%), 29 NC (16%), and 4 PD (2%). At a median follow-up of almost 2 years (22 months; range, 6-58 months), limb salvage was achieved in 82%. Regional toxicity was limited and systemic toxicity minimal to moderate, easily managed, with no toxic deaths.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In the setting of isolated limb perfusion, TNF is an active anticancer drug in patients. The ILP with TNF + melphalan can be performed safely in many centers and is an effective induction treatment with a high response rate that can achieve limb salvage in patients with locally advanced extremity soft tissue sarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '7749108', '_score': 175.05524, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Graft Survival [D006085:minor]', 'Graft vs Host Disease [D006086:minor]/etiology [Q000209:minor]', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation [D018380:major]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]', 'Histocompatibility [D006648:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin [D008228:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Neoplasms [D009369:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:major]', 'Neuroblastoma [D009447:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching [D001788:minor]', 'Neurofibroma [D009455:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Pelvic Neoplasms [D010386:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Remission Induction [D012074:minor]', 'Bone Marrow Diseases [D001855:minor]/chemically induced [Q000139:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Combined Modality Therapy [D003131:minor]', 'Endodermal Sinus Tumor [D018240:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Fetal Blood [D005312:minor]/cytology [Q000166:major]'], 'text': "Unrelated, HLA-mismatched multiple human umbilical cord blood transfusion in four cases with advanced solid tumors: initial studies.\n\n\nFour patients with advanced solid tumors were treated by means of high-dose chemotherapy and HLA-mismatched and unrelated multi-cord blood transfusion.

SINE are a family of small-molecules that selectively inhibit nuclear export through covalent binding to Cysteine 528 (Cys528) in the cargo binding pocket of XPO1. This leads to forced nuclear retention of cargo proteins that include major tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, FOXO, pRB and IkB. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated selinexor activity in hematologic malignancies as well as in certain solid tumors, and it is currently in Phase I and II clinical trials for advanced cancers. In this study, we evaluated the effects of selinexor in several preclinical models of various sarcoma subtypes.Materials and MethodsThe efficacy of selinexor was tested in vitro and in vivo using 17 cell lines and 10 sarcoma xenograft models including gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), liposarcoma (LPS), leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcomas, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS). Following exposure of cell lines to selinexor, effects on cell viability, cell cycle, and RNA and protein expression were determined. In sarcoma xenograft studies, selinexor was administered twice a week by oral gavage and changes in tumor size were recorded.ResultsMost sarcoma cell lines were sensitive to selinexor with IC50s ranging from 28.8 nM to 218.2 nM (median: 66.1 nM). The ASPS cell lines were exceptionally resistant to selinexor with IC50 greater than 2 M. Selinexor suppressed sarcoma tumor xenograft growth, including models of ASPS that were resistant in vitro. Cell lines from several sarcoma subtypes with defined molecular backgrounds, such as GIST with KIT mutations and dedifferentiated LPS with MDM2 and CDK4 amplification, were treated with selinexor to investigate its mechanism of action. Selinexor induced G1 arrest in GIST cells without attenuation of phosphorylation of KIT, AKT, or MAPK, in contrast to imatinib. In LPS cell lines selinexor induced G1-arrest and apoptosis irrespective of p53 expression or mutation status and induced G1-arrest irrespective of RB expression. Selinexor increased p53 and p21 expression at the protein but not RNA levels, indicating a post-transcriptional effect.ConclusionsSelinexor has potent in vitro and in vivo activity against a wide variety of sarcoma models. Selinexor induced G1-arrest independent of known molecular mechanisms in GIST and LPS. These studies further justify the exploration of selinexor in clinical trials targeting various sarcoma subtypes.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20107912', '_score': 173.33507, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Cohort Studies [D015331:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Postoperative Complications [D011183:minor]', 'Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures [D019651:major]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Surgical Flaps [D013524:major]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Health Status [D006304:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Limb Salvage [D023821:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]'], 'text': 'Function and health status outcomes following soft tissue reconstruction for limb preservation in extremity soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: While advances in reconstructive surgery have facilitated limb preservation in extremity soft tissue sarcoma (ESTS), limited information exists as to the functional outcome of patients with these reconstructed extremities.

In particular, nerve tolerance to high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy has never been properly evaluated. In this study, we examined the efficacy and radiation neurotoxicity of HDR brachytherapy in patients with STS in contact with neurovascular structures.\n\nMETHODS: Between 1995 and 2000, seven patients with STS involving the neurovascular bundle were treated in our institute with limb-preserving surgery, followed by fractionated HDR brachytherapy. Pathological examination demonstrated that 6 patients had high-grade lesions with five cases of negative margins and one case with positive margins, and one patient had a low-grade lesion with a negative margin. Afterloading catheters placed within the tumor bed directly upon the preserved neurovascular structures were postoperatively loaded with Iridium-192 with a total dose of 50 Gy in 6 patients. One patient received 30 Gy of HDR brachytherapy combined with 20 Gy of adjuvant external beam radiation.\n\nRESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4 years, the 5-year actuarial overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control rates were 83.3, 68.6, and 83.3%, respectively.

In all BMP-positive bone tumors, immunostaining was localized in the cytoplasm of primitive mesenchymal cells, with little or no staining in tumor matrix and more mature osteoblastic/chondrocytic cells. Among soft tissue sarcomas, MFHs (11 of 12), liposarcomas (5 of 11), leiomyosarcomas (3 of 9), and malignant schwannomas (3 of 8) showed cytoplasmic BMP immunostaining.

In these tumors, BMP is localized predominantly to the cytoplasm of malignant cells with primitive mesenchymal features; no or little BMP is detected in the more differentiated elements of bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

Several studies demonstrated that some subsets of patients could be safely treated by surgery alone, with acceptable rates of local recurrence. The aim of this study was to better clarify the necessity for adjuvant therapy and the width of the resected margin, by investigating the clinicopathological results of T1 (≤5 cm) soft tissue sarcomas.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted in 96 adult patients treated for nonmetastatic AJCC T1 primary non-small round cell soft tissue sarcomas in our institution from 1995 to 2008. There were 49 men and 47 women ranging in age from 18 to 85 years (mean 51), and the observation period was 6-159 months (mean 52). The site of origin was the upper extremity in 21 cases, the lower extremity in 45, and the trunk in 30. Forty-four cases had high-grade malignant tumors, and 52 had low-grade malignant ones. Tumor size ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 cm (median size, 3.5 cm). Thirty-nine cases (41%) had previously undergone unplanned excision elsewhere.\n\nRESULTS: Eighty-nine (93%) of the patients were continuously free of disease, four were alive and currently free of disease, one was alive with metastasis, and two had died. The event-free survival rate at 5 years was 93.3%. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 94.1%. In 23 of the 45 cases with unplanned excisions (51%) residual tumor was found on histological examination. After definitive surgery, 92 patients (96%) had R0 margins. Four patients (4%) had R1 margins and were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. Forty-five of 51 cases after planned biopsies (88%) showed infiltrative growth microscopically.\n\nCONCLUSION: Tumor size was found to have a major impact on the prognosis of soft tissue sarcomas, emphasizing the importance of early detection and early treatment of these tumors. Most patients suffering from T1 soft tissue sarcomas might be able to avoid adjuvant therapies including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To achieve good local control with surgery alone, an adequate surgical margin must be achieved even for small lesions.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27129163', '_score': 172.35129, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Downregulation of cyclin D1 sensitizes cancer cells to MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3.\n\n\nThe MDM2-p53 pathway has a prominent oncogenic function in the pathogenesis of various cancers.

Herein, we evaluate the expression of MDM2, both the full length and a splicing variant MDM2-A, and the sensitivity of Nutlin-3 in different cancer cell lines. Included are seven cell lines with wild-type p53 (four mesothelioma, one breast cancer, one chondrosarcoma, and one leiomyosarcoma), two liposarcoma cell lines harboring MDM2 amplification and wild-type p53, and one mesothelioma cell line harboring a p53 point mutation. Nutlin-3 treatment increased expression of cyclin D1, MDM2, and p53 in cell lines with wild-type p53. Additive effects were observed in cells containing wild-type p53 through coordinated attack on MDM2-p53 binding and cyclin D1 by lentivirual shRNA knockdown or small molecule inhibition, as demonstrated by immunoblots and cell viability analyses. Further results demonstrate that MDM2 binds to cyclin D1, and that an increase in cyclin D1 expression after Nutlin-3 treatment is correlated with expression and ubiquitin E3-ligase activity of MDM2. MDM2 and p53 knockdown experiments demonstrated inhibition of cyclin D1 by MDM2 but not p53.

An earlier study of 51 cases from our group showed that the tumor follows a benign course without any tendency for recurrence. In 1 case, an intralesional microscopic nodule of pleomorphic liposarcoma was observed. The biologic significance of atypia or sarcomatous transformation in cellular angiofibroma remains uncertain. In this study, we characterized clinicopathologic features in 13 cases of cellular angiofibroma with morphologic atypia or sarcomatous transformation. Thirteen cases with atypia or sarcomatous transformation among 154 usual cellular angiofibromas identified between 1993 and 2009 were retrieved from consultation files. There were 12 females and 1 male ranging in age from 39 to 71 years (median age, 46 y). Tumor size ranged from 1.2 to 7.5 cm. In 11 cases, the tumors occurred in the vulva. One case each occurred in the paratesticular and hip regions. Most tumors were located in subcutaneous tissue. There were 4 cases of cellular angiofibroma with atypia. Three showed severely atypical cells as scattered foci within the cellular angiofibroma. One case showed a discrete nodule of atypical cells. There were 9 cases of cellular angiofibroma with morphologic features of sarcomatous transformation. In each case, abrupt transition to a discrete sarcomatous component was seen. Of these 9 cases, the sarcomatous component in 2 cases showed features of pleomorphic liposarcoma with multivacuolated lipoblasts readily identified. Three of these 9 cases showed discrete nodule(s) closely resembling atypical lipomatous tumor within usual cellular angiofibroma. In the remaining 4 cases, the sarcomatous component was composed of pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in various patterns. By immunohistochemistry, atypical cells and sarcomatous areas showed either multifocal or more diffuse p16 expression compared with either scattered or negative expression in the conventional cellular angiofibroma. The 3 cases with atypical lipomatous tumor-like areas were negative for MDM-2 and CDK4. Follow-up information was available for 7 patients (range from 2 to 75 mo; median: 14 mo). Six patients did not develop recurrence or metastasis. One patient died of metastatic carcinoma of unknown primary site 27 months after the diagnosis of cellular angiofibroma with sarcomatous transformation. Cellular angiofibroma with atypia or morphologic sarcomatous transformation occurs predominantly in the subcutaneous tissue of the vulva and, as yet, shows no evident tendency to recur based on limited clinical follow-up available for 7 cases.

There was a slight female predilection (14F:12M). The most common symptom was a painless mass with or without increasing size. The trunk, extremities, head and neck, retroperitoneum, inguinal canal, peritoneal cavity, and lung were the tumor sites. Most tumors were circumscribed lipoblastomas and the minority were diffuse infiltrative lipoblastomatosis. Reexcision for residual or recurrent tumor was necessary more frequently in patients with lipoblastomatosis. Histopathologic examination and ultrastructural examination revealed cellular neoplasms composed of immature adipocytes with relatively well-defined septa, frequent lipoblasts, a fine vascular network, and often a myxoid appearance resembling myxoid liposarcoma. Cytogenetics was performed in 4 cases with chromosome 8q abnormality being most common. The major concern with lipoblastoma in children is to completely excise the tumor to avoid leaving residual tumor and to prevent recurrences.

As with carcinomatosis of epithelial origin, a rationale base supports an aggressive locoregional treatment of PS, but the use of CRS and HIPEC in this setting is still controversial. We assessed the outcome of clinically and pathologically homogeneous subsets of patients with PS uniformly treated by cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).\n\nMETHODS: A prospective database of 37 patients who underwent CRS and close-abdomen HIPEC with cisplatin and doxorubicin or mitomycin-C was reviewed. PS originated from GIST (pre-imatinib era) in 8 patients, uterine leiomyosarcoma (ULS) in 11, retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLP) in 13, and other sarcoma in 5.\n\nRESULTS: CRS was macroscopically complete in 28 patients (75.7%). Operative mortality was 3.7% and morbidity 21.6%. After median follow-up of 104 (range, 1-131) months, peritoneal disease progression occurred in 16 patients, distant metastases in 5, and both in 13. For all patients, median overall survival was 26.2 months; 7 patients were alive at 46-130 months (ULS, n = 4; RPLP, n = 2; GIST, n = 1). RPLP had the best overall survival (median, 34 months) but 100% peritoneal relapse; GIST had dismal overall, local-regional-free and distant-free survival; ULS had the higher proportion of long survivors and best local-regional-free survival.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, results of CRS and HIPEC did not compare favorably to those of conventional therapy. In a subgroup analysis, the combined approach did not change GIST and RPLS natural history. The interesting results with ULS may warrant further investigations.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24018792', '_score': 167.57268, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Dosage [D018628:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Imidazoles [D007093:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Models, Molecular [D008958:minor]', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation [D056004:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Piperazines [D010879:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide [D020641:minor]', 'Protein Conformation [D011487:minor]', 'Protein Isoforms [D020033:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins [D011518:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 [D016159:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Alternative Splicing [D017398:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cell Differentiation [D002454:minor]', 'Computer Simulation [D003198:minor]', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm [D019008:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/physiology [Q000502:minor]'], 'text': 'In vitro and in silico studies of MDM2/MDMX isoforms predict Nutlin-3A sensitivity in well/de-differentiated liposarcomas.\n\n\nThe molecular marker of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas is MDM2 gene amplification coupled with protein overexpression and wild-type TP53. MDMX is a recently identified MDM2 homolog and its presence in this tumor is unexplored. Our aim was to investigate the role of full-length MDM2 and MDMX proteins and their isoforms in surgical specimens of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas in view of Nutlin-3A (a MDM2 inhibitor) treatment. Frozen and matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material from surgical specimens was examined by means of: (1) fluorescence in situ hybridization to determine MDM2 and MDMX gene copy numbers; (2) RT-PCR and densitometry to analyze alternative splicing forms of mdm2 and mdmx; (3) immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry to assess the corresponding translated proteins; and (4) in vitro and in silico assays to determine their affinity for Nutlin-3A. All these cases showed MDM2 gene amplification with an MDMX disomic pattern. In all cases, the full-length mdm2 transcript was associated with the mdm2-b transcript, with ratios ranging from 0.07 to 5.6, and both were translated into protein; mdmx and mdmx-s were co-transcripted, with ratios ranging from 0.1 to 5.6. MDMX-S was frequently more upregulated than MDMX at both transcriptional and protein level. Each case showed different amounts of mdm2, mdm2-b, mdmx, and mdmx-s transcripts and the corresponding proteins. In vitro assays showed that Nutlin-3A was ineffective against MDM2-B and was unable to disrupt the MDMX/TP53 and MSMX-S/TP53 complexes. Molecular simulations confirmed these in vitro findings by showing that MDM2 has high Nutlin-3A affinity, followed by MDMX-S, MDMX, and MDM2-B. Nutlin-3A is predicted to be a good therapeutic option for well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas.

Biokinetic impacts on structure and imaging of the lung: the concept of biologically closed electric circuits.\n\n\nThe corona complex of the lung is a collection of radiographic features surrounding a pulmonary mass. Each of its 12 components may be explained by a recently described subset of biologically closed electric circuits, the vascular-interstitial closed electric circuit (VICC) system. This system is activated both by normal metabolism of tissue and by local degrading processes, such as spontaneous necrosis or hemorrhage, that lead to local electrochemical polarization of a lesion in relation to surrounding noninjured tissue. Ions, cells, and water are transported electrically in the VICC system, leading to the development of the corona complex. The VICC system is conceived to exist with the walls of arteries and veins functioning as insulators around the electrically conducting medium of blood, the plasma. Blood vessels therefore connect electrically the injured and noninjured tissues. At the capillary level, electric junctions connect plasma and interstitial fluid, which functions as an electrical conductor comparable to blood plasma. The interstitial fluid therefore completes the circuit. The VICC system can be regarded as an additional circulatory system for selective electrogenic transports, coupled directly to the mechanical circulation of blood and lymph. The injury potential represents an important energetic factor in the activation of the VICC system. It is a slowly fluctuating, attenuating, electrochemical potential inducing ebb and flow of time-dependent anionic and cationic transports. The corona structures are special effects of the healing of injured tissue. The 12 radiologic signs of the corona complex have each been produced experimentally in vitro in animals and in vivo in humans during electrochemical treatment of cancers. The "A" zone is characterized radiographically by radiolucency around an electrically polarizing focal lesion. Peripheral to the A zone, a "B" zone is seen as a radiopaque region. The A and B zones are predominantly the result of an electroosmotic outflow of water from a lesion during its electropositive phase. At the interface between the A and B zones, small arches sometimes form an arcade. This configuration develops when the polarizing lesion has small protrusions at its surface. As a result of electrical edge enhancement, various elements of the interstitial tissue are transformed into radiating fibrous structures. They grow out at right angles to the surface of the lesion and serve as supporting columns for the arches. When necrotic material from a tumor is evacuated through a bronchus, ensuing collapse of the tumor will displace those radiating structures already produced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27241607', '_score': 166.22386, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Rare case of a liposarcoma in the brachial plexus.\n\n\nIntroduction A liposarcoma is a rare cancer of connective tissues that resemble fat cells under light microscopy.

Data concerning the genomic alterations of LSC are almost nonexistent. Here, we report on the first molecular cytogenetic characterization of a metastatic LSC. Cytogenetic and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) analyses showed a near-triploid karyotype with numerous structural aberrations and four to six small supernumerary marker chromosomes containing chromosome 9 sequences. Comparative genomic hybridization on arrays (array CGH) detected an amplification of 9p23 approximately p24.3 and gains of 1q11 approximately q23.3, 3q26.2 approximately q29, and 17q23.2 approximately q24.1. The 9p amplification was also detected in the primary tumor and another metastasis of the same patient, indicating it was a significant element in the pathogenesis of this LSC case. Complementary FISH analysis showed that the small supernumerary chromosomes were isochromosomes for 9p23 approximately p24.3. These isochromosomes were lacking alpha-satellite sequences although they were still stable after 55 passages in culture. As demonstrated by immunostaining with anti-centromere antibodies, they contained a functional centromere. So-called analphoid "neocentromeres" are rare and have been mainly described in constitutional abnormal karyotypes. This case is the third description of the identification of neocentromeres in cancer, (i.e. well-differentiated liposarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia), and is the first one in a carcinoma. Our results suggest that the 9p23 neocentromere of this case of LSC might be similar to a 9p23 neocentromere previously identified in two constitutional cases. The frequency of neocentromere formation in solid tumors may indeed be underestimated and may have a significant implication in chromosomal instability in tumor cells.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27511215', '_score': 164.4228, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Sustained clinico-radiologic response to anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody therapy in metastatic myxoid liposarcoma.\n\n\nRarity and heterogeneity of sarcomas pose significant challenges in terms of developing new therapies.

Nine malignant soft tissue tumors (4 liposarcomas, 3 synovial sarcomas, one malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and one extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EOS)) which arose at the extremities of adult patients were analyzed by the DOX binding assay using freshly biopsied specimens.

By systematically assessing alterations affecting the p53 pathway, we aimed to (a) classify sarcoma subtypes, (b) define a potential role in malignancy, and (c) identify potential patient biomarkers in this heterogeneous disease.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have mapped mutational events in a panel of 192 benign or malignant bone and soft-tissue sarcomas. Analyses included TP53 and CDKN2A mutational and SNP status, MDM2 and MDM4 amplification and MDM2 SNP309 status.\n\nRESULTS: We found an inverse relationship between MDM2 amplification and TP53 mutations, with a predominantly wild-type CDKN2A background. A high rate of point mutations in TP53 was observed uniquely in leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and MFH. Both MDM2 and MDM4 were also amplified in a subtype-specific manner, which was frequently seen as a coamplification event. We have also analyzed the risk allele frequencies for MDM2 SNP309, and show that the G allele was strongly associated with both liposarcomas and MDM2 amplification.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data emphasize the critical role of p53 inactivation in sarcomagenesis, whereby different pathway alterations may be related to the heterogeneity of the disease. Moreover, we observed a strong association of malignancy with TP53 mutation, or MDM2 amplification and the presence of a G allele in SNP309, especially in lipoma versus liposarcoma.

Regarding primary treatment in primary surgical intervention resection was radical (R0) in 7 of 14 (50%) patients, marginal (R1) in 6 (43%) patients, and incomplete with macroscopic residual tumour (R2) in 1 (7%) patient. Primary treatment secondary surgical intervention was performed in 4 patients: resection was radical (R0) in 3 (75%) patients and marginal (R1) in 1 (25%) patient. Regarding secondary treatment in recurrent disease resection was marginal (R1) in 3 patients (100%). Final histologic margins were negative in 10 patients with primary disease (71%) and positive in 4 patients with subsequent recurrent disease. After radical resection disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 100%. Overall survival at 4.5 years (54 (18-180) months) was 64%.\n\nCONCLUSION: An incomplete first surgical step increases the number of positive margins leading to local recurrences and adverse prognoses. Aggressive surgery should be attempted to attain 3-dimensional negative margins.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23774173', '_score': 162.55019, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Genetic Testing [D005820:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Italy [D007558:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques [D025202:major]', 'Mutation [D009154:minor]', 'Predictive Value of Tests [D011237:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit [D019009:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction [D060888:minor]', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha [D020796:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction [D020133:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Translocation, Genetic [D014178:minor]', 'Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Biopsy [D001706:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'France [D005602:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease [D020022:minor]'], 'text': 'Impact of molecular analysis on the final sarcoma diagnosis: a study on 763 cases collected during a European epidemiological study.\n\n\nSarcomas are rare, heterogenous, and often difficult to classify.

By detailed histopathologic examination, most cases could be categorized into specific tumor types. Eight sarcomas were diagnosed as lipogenic (4 pleomorphic, 1 combined pleomorphic and myxoid/round cell, and 3 dedifferentiated liposarcomas), 19 as myogenic [11 leiomyosarcomas, 1 rhabdomyosarcoma, 4 myosarcomas not otherwise specified (NOS), and 3 probable myosarcomas NOS], 8 as myxofibrosarcomas, 1 as a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, 1 as malignant mesenchymoma, 1 as extraskeletal osteosarcoma, I as sarcoma resembling proliferative fasciitis, and 7 as pleomorphic sarcomas NOS. In a three-grade system, 10 tumors were grade 2 and 36 were grade 3. The majority had highly complex karyotypes. A total of 24 recurrent abnormalities (defined by their presence in at least five cases) were detected: ring chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions (hsr) and/or double minute chromosomes (dmin), and structural rearrangement of 22 different chromosome bands or regions. The frequency and distribution of the recurrent karyotypic features were uneven. Grade 3 tumors displayed, on average, more aberrations per case than did grade 2 tumors. Nine of the selected abnormalities, including hsr/dmin and rearrangements of 19p13 and 19q13, were found only among the high-grade tumors. When the tumors were subdivided according to lineage of differentiation, the highest frequency of aberrations was seen in pleomorphic sarcomas NOS, followed by myxofibrosarcomas, myogenic sarcomas, and lipogenic sarcomas. None of the selected rearrangements was, however, specific for any of these subgroups. The sole consistent cytogenetic-morphologic association was that all three dedifferentiated liposarcomas had multiple abnormal clones, at least one of which contained supernumerary ring chromosomes. Due mainly to karyotype complexity, it therefore seems unlikely that cytogenetic analysis can assist in the differential diagnostic subclassification of pleomorphic sarcomas, nor was there any clear-cut indication that the karyotypic picture could be used to predict clinical outcome. Although the mean number of recurrent chromosome aberrations was almost twice as high in sarcomas that gave rise to metastases as among those that did not, no particular aberration was restricted to either of the two subgroups.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20508829', '_score': 162.45972, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Left supraclavicular spindle cell lipoma.\n\n\nBackground.

CT neck showed a left supraclavicular mass of fatty density with fine internal septations. A low-grade liposarcoma could not be excluded. Histopathology. FNA was indeterminate. Histology of specimen showed bland spindle cells with no evidence of malignancy. Immuno-histochemistry showed SCL with CD34 positivity and negative staining on CDK4 and p16. Management. Excision biopsy of the mass was performed which was technically difficult as the mass invaginated around the brachial plexus.

The tumor was resected and histologically diagnosed as conventional DDLPS, in which dedifferentiated component was highly cellular and composed of pleomorphic anaplastic cells. After 3 years, the tumor recurred in the right retroperitoneal space. The recurrent tumor consisted of 2 components: lipogenic and nonlipogenic. The latter differ from the dedifferentiated component of the primary tumor. The tumor cells were small, round to ovoid cells with monomorphous, round, hyperchromatic nuclei, and scant cytoplasm. Interestingly, they were diffusely positive for myogenin and desmin. To rule out the possibility of the second primary, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect FOXO1 rearrangement. We failed to demonstrate splits of the probes. In contrast, high-level amplification of MDM2 was detected by dual-color in situ hybridization.

We found MDM-2 gene amplification in 12 (26%) of 46 cases of sarcoma: 11 of 13 cases of liposarcoma and 1 of 6 cases of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. The MDM-2 amplification correlated with the presence of elevated levels of mRNA and protein in the liposarcomas.

However, their behavior is dominated by the carcinomatous component. CD34 is useful in distinguishing carcinomas with sarcomatoid features from epithelioid sarcomas, as it is never expressed in carcinomas although often expressed in epithelioid sarcomas. This investigation hypothesizes that CD34 expression in FGTCSs will contribute useful histogenetic and clinical information. Paraffin sections from a surgical series of 43 FGTCSs were stained using anti-CD34 with an automated immunohistochemical stainer, antigen retrieval, and appropriate external/internal controls. Reactions were graded as follows: negative (N) or S1-3, strong reactivity in <10% = S1, 10-50% = S2, or >50% = S3 of cells, respectively. The series included 31 endometrial, 6 ovarian, 5 cervical, and 1 fallopian tubal FGTCSs, 70% exhibiting heterologous elements (22 rhabdomyosarcomas, 11 chondrosarcomas, 1 osteosarcoma, and 1 liposarcoma). The carcinomatous component included 19 endometrioid, 12 serous, 6 adenosquamous, 4 clear cell, and 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas: modified International Federation of Gynecologic Oncology grade I, 9%; II, 21%; and III, 70%. CD34 reactivity was 100% N in the carcinomatous components. CD 34 stained 21 % of sarcomatous components as follows: 2S1, 6S2, and 1S3 (three homologous and six heterologous). Of the heterologous components, only rhabdomyosarcoma stained with the following patterns: 1S1, 2S2, 1S3. Two of six heterologous FGTCSs exhibited staining of only the homologous sarcomatous component with the following pattern: 2S2, as the heterologous sarcomatous component (pure rhabdomyosarcoma in both cases) showed no staining. The staining pattern was unrelated to primary site of the FGTCSs. The pattern of CD34 expression (N in the carcinomatous component like carcinomas) supports the generally accepted opinion of dominance of FGTCS by the carcinomatous component. The staining of the sarcomatous component was rare (21%) and focal (only one of nine was S3). CD34 staining may help distinguish FGTCSs from epithelioid sarcomas, which strongly express CD34.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '11309816', '_score': 161.19638, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Amplification [D005784:major]', 'Gene Dosage [D018628:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted [D007091:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization [D009693:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Bone Neoplasms [D001859:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Chromosome Aberrations [D002869:minor]', 'Chromosome Banding [D002871:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]'], 'text': 'DNA copy number amplifications in sarcomas with homogeneously staining regions and double minutes.\n\n\nTo identify DNA amplifications in sarcomas, comparative genomic hybridization was performed on 27 cases that were likely to display high-level DNA copy number gains.

Rare cases of MLS show a variant t(12;22) translocation, resulting in EWS-CHOP fusion gene. The CHOP gene encodes a leucine-zipper transcription factor, which is implicated in both oncogenic transformation and inhibition of adipogenesis. To examine whether the molecular variability of TLS-CHOP or EWS-CHOP fusion transcript structure is associated with the degree of inhibition of adipogenesis, a comparative ultrastructural and RT-PCR-based analysis of 14 MLS was performed. The specimens consisted of 9 primary, 2 locally recurrent tumors, and one representative sample each from 3 patients with multifocal soft tissue metastases. Histologically, there were 8 high-grade and 6 low-grade MLS using 5% round cell (RC) component as the cutoff point. By RT-PCR assay there were 13 cases with TLS-CHOP fusion transcripts: 7 cases of type 5-2 (known as type II), 4 cases of type 7-2 (known as type I),1 case of type 8-2 (known as type III), and 1 unique case of type 6-2. The remaining 1 case showed an EWS-CHOP fusion transcript. Ultrastructural examination revealed that tumor cells were composed of a moderate-to-predominant proportion of well-formed lipoblasts in 4 cases, while in 6 cases such lipoblasts were very scant. The remaining 4 tumors were arrested in the stage of transitional cells. The heterogeneity of TLS-CHOP fusion transcript showed no apparent impact on adipogenesis, since both TLS-CHOP type I and II cases could randomly display various levels of lipoblastic differentiation. Furthermore, the 4 cases without definite lipoblasts showed no preference for any specific fusion variants and consisted of one each of TLS-CHOP subtypes. In addition, the fusion transcript variants did not correlate with other ultrastructural features, such as the presence and amount of glycogen, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, vimentin-like intermediate filaments, and external lamina. However, there appeared to have a trend suggesting the predilections of glycogen particles and vimentin-like intermediate filaments in primitive mesenchymal cells and/or transitional cells. These findings cannot substantiate the hypothesis that the molecular variability of fusion transcripts has a biological impact on adipogenesis of MLS, and other factors might be implicated in their level of differentiation.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27402219', '_score': 160.27576, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: clinicopathologic study of 15 cases with emphasis on novel expression of MDM2, somatostatin receptor 2A, and PD-L1.\n\n\nFollicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a rare low-grade neoplasm with the phenotype of FDC cells. This rare sarcoma has been well known for being mistaken for a variety of neoplasms (mainly meningioma), particularly at extranodal sites. Diagnosis of FDCS mainly relies on characteristic histologic appearance supplemented by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. In this study, we reviewed 15 FDCSs retrieved from our consultation files and stained them for newly reported or novel markers (PD-L1, Rb1, MDM2, and somatostatin receptor 2A [SSTR2A]) in addition to conventional FDC markers. Patients were 7 men and 7 women (1 unspecified) with a mean age of 47 years (20-75 years). The tumor site was lymph nodes (6) or spleen (2), both (1) and extranodal sites of head and neck (4) or abdominal cavity (2). Treatment was variable combinations of surgery and aggressive chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Four of 8 patients with follow-up died of disease within 1 to 10 years. All tumors expressed at least 1 FDC marker: CD21 (8/13), CD23 (2/13), CD35 (8/12), CNA.42 (13/14), Clusterin (8/13), Fascin (15/15) and D2-40/podoplanin (7/14). Epstein-Barr virus (EBER-1/2 in situ hybridization) was performed successfully in 10 conventional variants; all were negative. Five of 14 cases (36%) stained strongly for SSTR2A with a distinctive membranous pattern. Residual lymphoid follicles surrounding some of the tumors stained similarly for SSTR2A. Seven (54%) of 13 assessable cases showed moderate to strong membranous staining for PD-L1 in greater than 5% of the neoplastic cells. The Rb1 antigen was lost in 4 (28%) of 14 cases. MDM2 stained less than 5% to 20% of the tumor cells in 5 (36%) of 14 cases; 2 of them showed amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). CDK4 was negative except for weak staining in 1 of 14 cases. This study adds to the existing few clinicopathologic series on FDCS and represents the first study to show MDM2 amplification in this entity. Our results regarding frequent SSTR2A expression in FDCS are novel and might be of potential diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. SSTR2A expression in FDCS represents a further confusing factor when thinking of meningioma which uniformly expresses this receptor.

A tricenter update.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative radiation with sensitizing doxorubicin has been popularized in the treatment of high grade sarcoma of the extremity. A multiinstitutional experience with this protocol that was initiated by the Southeastern Cancer Study Group in 1984 and maintained in three institutions was updated by the authors.\n\nMETHODS: Patients with biopsied sarcoma had intraarterial infusion with doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin) 30 mg/24 hrs x 3 days and were allocated by the institution to receive radiation 30-35 Gy in 10 fractions or 46 Gy in 23-25 fractions followed by resection. Surgery was performed within 10 days or 30 days depending on the radiation dose. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered to 31 patients.\n\nRESULTS: Of 66 patients, 32 were female and 34 were male. The median age was 46 years (range, 14-77 years); 73% had lower and 27% had upper extremity tumors. There were 55 soft-tissue and 9 malignant bone tumors. Common types were malignant fibrous histiocytoma 20%; liposarcoma, 17%; synovial sarcoma 18%; and 14% were osteosarcoma. American Joint Committee on Cancer stages were: I, IIB (17%), IIIA/B (59%), and IIIC/4A (24%). Limb salvage surgery was performed on 60 patients including radical resection in 21 with extensive tumors, wide local excision in 30, and limited excision in 2 patients. Primary amputation was performed on four patients and delayed amputation in two because of wound complications. Three patients had pulmonary metastasectomy in conjunction with primary surgery (2 are long term survivors > 5 years). There were no postoperative deaths, but wound complications occurred in 41% of the patients. Overall survival and disease free survival at 5 years was 59 and 49%. One patient (1.5%) had local recurrence 9 years after resection of an extensive synovial sarcoma of the shoulder. This was resected with limb salvage techniques. Among 23 patients who failed primarily in the lung, the median survival was 7 months with 4 surviving more than 5 years, after demonstration of the pulmonary metastases. Multivariant analysis of prognostic factors showed that extent of disease and stage correlated with disease free survival, whereas only extent of surgical resection correlated with overall surgical survival.\n\nCONCLUSION: Combined therapy for extremity sarcoma in a multicenter setting using preoperative radiation with sensitizing chemotherapy and adequate resection was associated with an excellent local control rate (98.5%) and reasonable long term tumor control, although distant metastases continued to be a major challenge.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_133596-144', '_score': 159.44107, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: Characterization of isolated, uncomplicated neutropeniarelated to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.\n\n\n\nBackground:   Palbociclib (P), an oral, selective, reversible CDK4/6 inhibitor induces transient G1 arrest in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC), without DNA damage or apoptosis in preclinical studies.  In patients (pts) with advanced malignancy, P had activity in several tumor types, but neutropenia was dose-limiting. We sought to characterize the incidence and patterns of myelosuppression to determine if the mechanisms observed preclinically were reflected in the clinical experience.  Methods:  Data from 2 phase 2 studies of single agent P in pts with advanced RB+ tumors (UPenn, NCT01037790) and liposarcoma (MSKCC, NCT01209598) were analyzed. Dose (125 mg P), schedule (3 wks on/1 wk off) and safety assessments (baseline, weekly cycle 1 and d 1 of subsequent cycle) were identical. Both trials required P be held for > grade (Gr) 3 myelosuppression until resolved to < Gr 2.   Results:  140 patients with breast (36%), sarcoma (21%), germ cell (21%), colon (13%), gastric (7%) tumors were enrolled.  Neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia rates in cycle 1 by Gr are shown.  Mean absolute neutrophil count was 4.98, 4.24, 2.15, 1.62 and 1.86 at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, reflecting time to nadir.  Time to Gr3 neutropenia was 3 wks in 11%, 4 wks in 30%, 5 wks in 14%.  Recovery occurred after brief dose delay.  Neutropenia led to dose interruption in 19% of pts in cycle 1 and 8% had Gr3 neutropenia on day 1/cycle 2. Despite the high rate of Gr 3/4 neutropenia (39%), only 1 episode of neutropenic fever occurred (in setting of disease progression), with no infections or use of G-CSF.  Mucositis was rare and <Gr2.  Concurrent Gr3 anemia or thrombocytopenia were rare (6% and 15% respectively).  Conclusions:  Frequent, isolated and uncomplicated neutropenia in patients receiving P is consistent with preclinically observed quiescence but not death of HSPC and little effect on differentiated myeloid cells.  The lack of clinical morbidity or pancytopenia suggests that P-induced neutropenia is short lasting, reversible and may be managed conservatively.

The measurement of the MDM2 amplification can aid in classification and may provide a predictive value for recently formulated therapies targeting MDM2. We have developed and validated an automated bright field dual-color in situ hybridization application to detect MDM2 gene amplification.\n\nDESIGN: A repeat-depleted MDM2 probe was constructed to target the MDM2 gene region at 12q15. A chromosome 12-specific probe (CHR12) was generated from a pα12H8 plasmid. The in situ hybridization assay was developed by using a dinitrophenyl-labeled MDM2 probe and a digoxigenin-labeled CHR12 probe on the Ventana Medical Systems' automated slide-staining platforms. The specificity of the MDM2 and CHR12 probes was shown on metaphase spreads and further validated against controls, including normal human tonsil and known MDM2-amplified samples. The assay performance was evaluated on a cohort of 100 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens by using a conventional bright field microscope.\n\nRESULTS: Simultaneous hybridization and signal detection for MDM2 and CHR12 showed that both DNA targets were present in the same cells. One hundred soft tissue specimens were stained for MDM2 and CHR12. Although 26 of 29 lipomas were nonamplified and eusomic, MDM2 amplification was noted in 78% of atypical lipomatous tumors or well-differentiated liposarcomas. Five of 6 dedifferentiated liposarcoma cases were amplified for MDM2. MDM2 amplification was observed in 1 of 8 osteosarcomas; 3 showed CHR12 aneusomy. MDM2 amplification was present in 1 of 4 chondrosarcomas. Nine of 10 synovial sarcomas displayed no evidence of MDM2 amplification in most tumor cells. In pleomorphic sarcoma, not otherwise specified (pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma), MDM2 was amplified in 38% of cases, whereas 92% were aneusomic for CHR12. One alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma and 2 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas displayed low-level aneusomy of CHR12 without net MDM2 amplifications.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These results show that the use of the ISH MDM2 and CHR12 assay allows simultaneous analyses of the 2 DNA targets within the context of tissue morphology. This method combines the advantages of a fully automated protocol with bright field microscopy and has the potential for routine application in surgical pathology."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8136388', '_score': 158.59552, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Hemangiosarcoma [D006394:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neurilemmoma [D009442:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma [D012208:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:major]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:major]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Germany [D005858:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]', 'Hemangiopericytoma [D006393:minor]/diagnostic imaging [Q000000981:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]'], 'text': '[Computed tomography in malignant primary soft tissue tumors].\n\n\nThe results of CT examinations in 36 patients suffering from histologically confirmed malignant primary tumours of the soft tissues are presented (6 rhabdomyosarcomas, 4 leiomyosarcomas, 6 liposarcomas, 4 malignant schwannomas, 5 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 4 malignant haemangiopericytomas, 3 angiosarcomas, 1 fibrosarcoma, 1 renal sarcoma, 2 malignant mesenchymal tumours without histologically clear classification).

De-differentiated liposarcoma (DDLS) is associated with increased frequency of recurrence and lower overall survival. We aimed to identify gene expression changes associated with OS in DDLS. Secondary aims was to postulate a mechanism for DDLS.\n\nMethods: We analysed data from gene expression omnibus (GEO, ID = GSE30929) to identify genes associated with DDLS (n=39). A signature representing genes overexpressed in DDLS was then applied to an independent dataset, utilising data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n=58 DDLS) to segregate samples based on gene expression and groupings compared for survival.\n\nResults: A 5 gene signature was generated consisting of genes with increased expression in DDLS and its relation to OS. The signature was significantly enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism (AQP7, PRKAR2B, FABP4 p<0.01) and genes involved in the cell cycle and cell proliferation (FBN2, CEBPA p<0.01). Segregation of DDLS in the TCGA cohort on the basis of median gene signature score gave a significant difference in overall survival. High score (stronger DDLS signature) was associated with a lower median survival(33.5 vs 76.4 months, p = 0.027), and poorer 2 year (63.4% vs 89.2%) and 5 year survival (20.6% vs 71.1%). The survival difference remained significant when applied to retroperitoneal DDLS only (n=51, median survival 34.5 vs 54.2 months, p = 0.034) and poorer 2 year survival (. A postulated mechanism is that DDLS have gained deficiency in AQP7, PRKAR2B and FABP4 leading to fatty acid and glycerol accumulation in cells, increasing cancer cell replication. CEBPA inhibits CDK4 and a deficiency of CEBPA in DDLS leads to up regulation of CDK4, increasing cell proliferation. An upregulation of FBN2 in DDLS up regulates TGF-β1, increasing cell proliferation.\n\nConclusion: Gene expression changes associated with dedifferentiated liposarcomas include changes in cell cycle checkpoint regulation. The signature is associated with poorer overall survival in DDLS and can be used to prognosticate patients.\n\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '11516857', '_score': 158.23495, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Fibrosis [D005355:minor]/etiology [Q000209:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Intraoperative Period [D007432:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Neurilemmoma [D009442:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Regression Analysis [D012044:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Survival Analysis [D016019:minor]', 'Wound Healing [D014945:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Confidence Intervals [D016001:minor]', 'Connective Tissue [D003238:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/radiation effects [Q000528:major]', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation [D004307:minor]', 'Extremities [D005121:major]'], 'text': 'Correlation of intraoperatively irradiated volume and fibrosis in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremities.\n\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate the influence of intraoperatively irradiated volume on soft-tissue fibrosis.\n\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty-three patients with soft-tissue sarcoma of the extremities were treated with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) (median dose 15 Gy) and postoperative fractionated therapy (median dose 46 Gy). The median follow-up was 41.5 months (range 18-94). Late toxicity was classified according to the LENT-SOMA criteria. A Cox regression model was calculated to identify the parameters that could influence soft-tissue fibrosis Grade 3 or 4. Five parameters were observed: extent of surgical procedure, IORT in case of recurrence, extent of IORT volume, extent of IORT dose, and extent of postoperative volume. In addition, a logistic regression model was calculated to demonstrate the relationship between the IORT volume and fibrosis development.\n\nRESULTS: The overall survival rate after 5 years was 84%. The actuarial tumor control rate was 90% after 5 years. Eleven patients developed soft-tissue fibrosis. Five patients developed Grade 3 fibrosis and 1 patient developed Grade 4 fibrosis. Only the IORT volume had a significant influence on Grade 3 or 4 fibrosis development. An IORT volume of 210 cm(3) conveyed a 5% risk (confidence interval 1-20%) of the development of severe fibrosis. The risk of severe Grade 3 or 4 fibrosis increased to 50% (confidence interval 15-80%) if a volume of 420 cm(3) was irradiated.\n\nCONCLUSION: The effect of volume in patients treated with IORT was remarkable.

Five-year overall survival (OS) and crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of local recurrence (LR) and distant metastases (DM) were calculated. Multivariate analyses for OS and CCI of LR and DM were performed. Postrelapse OS was investigated.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 377 patients were identified. Median follow-up from the time of primary surgery was 44 months [interquartile range (IQR) 27-82]. Five-year OS was 64 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.588, 0710].

The aim of our study was to define the relationship between microvessel density (MVD), evaluated with CD31, and other immunohistochemical markers, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), CD34, maspin, DOG-1, and c-KIT. Immunostains were done in 55 cases consisting of benign and malignant tumors, such as liposarcomas, dermatofibrosarcomas, and tumors with histiocytic differentiation. Renal tubes were used as external control for VEGF, maspin, and DOG-1. Although DOG-1 is considered a specific marker for gastrointestinal tumors (GISTs), its positivity, correlated with c-KIT and VEGF immunoexpression, was also shown by dermatofibrosarcomas and tumors with histiocytic and lipomatous differentiation, suggesting its possible pro-angiogenic role. Maspin expression was observed in adipose tissue tumors only. Regarding angiogenesis, 31 of the 55 cases were VEGF-positive, such positivity being directly correlated with COX-2 and CD34 positivity as evaluated in the tumor cells and also with MVD. Although no significant differences in angiogenic activity were found between benign and malignant non-lipomatous tumors, the MVD was directly correlated with the histological type/grade of liposarcomas. Based on these aspects, we conclude that VEGF/COX-2-induced angiogenesis is specific for non-lipomatous tumors, whereas liposarcomas are dependent on the VEGF/maspin angiogenic pathway. The DOG-1/c-KIT/VEGF target may be used for further personalized therapy of soft tissue sarcomas.

We found that TLS enhanced the NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation induced by physiological stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, and overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase.

As a result, TLS was able to bind to all the seven fragments, but the fragments containing reported recognition motifs (GGUG and GGU) tend to bind more solidly. The full-length TLS and TLS-RGG2-zinc finger-RGG3 showed a similar interaction with pncRNA-D, but the binding specificity of TLS-RGG3 was lower compared to the full-length TLS and TLS-RGG2-zinc finger-RGG3.

All control cases exhibited MDM2 amplification and overexpression. To investigate possible polysomy of chromosome 12, we studied RASAL1 amplification, a gene telomeric to MDM2 on the long arm of chromosome 12. RASAL1 amplification was reported in all benign fibro-osseous lesions exhibiting MDM2 amplification but not in controls. Simultaneous amplification of these two genes was significantly higher in juvenile ossifying fibromas compared with fibrous dysplasia (P=0.004), non-juvenile ossifying fibromas (P=0.001), and all other benign craniofacial fibro-osseous lesions combined (P=0.0001).

The two cases of extragnathic psammomatoid fibrous dysplasia also showed MDM2 and RASAL1 amplification with no MDM2 overexpression. This large chromosome 12 rearrangement, spanning MDM2 and RASAL1, is the first recurrent molecular abnormality to be reported in juvenile ossifying fibroma. It may represent both a molecular diagnostic marker and a characteristic of more aggressive forms with a higher risk of recurrence. Finally, the presence of this rearrangement in extragnathic psammomatoid fibro-osseous lesions mimicking ossifying fibromas might reflect a common molecular pathway in their pathogenesis and calls into question the classification of such lesions within fibrous dysplasia.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '18927308', '_score': 154.01765, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose [D020714:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines [D044005:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/pharmacokinetics [Q000493:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Dioxoles [D004149:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor [D016179:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]'], 'text': 'Phase I combination study of trabectedin and doxorubicin in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma.\n\n\nPURPOSE: To determine the dose of trabectedin plus doxorubicin with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support associated with manageable neutropenia and acceptable dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in patients with recurrent or persistent soft-tissue sarcoma.\n\nMETHODS: In this phase I, open-label, multicenter trial, patients previously treated with 0-1 prior chemotherapy regimens excluding doxorubicin, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and adequate organ function received a 10- to 15-min i.v. infusion of doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) immediately followed by a 3-h i.v. infusion of trabectedin 0.9 to 1.3 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week cycle.

We have previously identified FLT1 (VEGFR1) as a candidate downstream target gene of FUS-DDIT3. The aim of this study was to investigate expression of FLT1 and its ligands in MLS cells.\n\nMETHODS: HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were transiently transfected with FUS-DDIT3-GFP variant constructs and FLT1 expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, FLT1, PGF, VEGFA and VEGFB expression was measured in MLS/RCLS cell lines, MLS/RCLS tumors and in normal adiopocytes. We analyzed nine cases of MLS/RCLS and one cell line xenografted in mice for FLT1 protein expression using immunohistochemistry. MLS/RCLS cell lines were also analyzed for FLT1 by immunofluorescence and western blot. MLS/RCLS cell lines were additionally treated with FLT1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and assayed for alterations in proliferation rate.\n\nRESULTS: FLT1 expression was dramatically increased in transfected cells stably expressing FUS-DDIT3 and present at high levels in cell lines derived from MLS. The FLT1 protein showed a strong nuclear expression in cells of MLS tissue as well as in cultured MLS cells, which was confirmed by cellular fractionation. Tissue array analysis showed a nuclear expression of the FLT1 protein also in several other tumor and normal cell types including normal adipocytes. The FLT1 ligand coding gene PGF was highly expressed in cultured MLS cells compared to normal adipocytes while the other ligand genes VEGFA and VEGFB were expressed to lower levels. A more heterogeneous expression pattern of these genes were observed in tumor samples. No changes in proliferation rate of MLS cells were detected at concentrations for which the kinase inhibitors have shown specific inhibition of FLT1.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that FLT1 is induced as an indirect downstream effect of FUS-DDIT3 expression in MLS. This could be a consequence of the ability of FUS-DDIT3 to hijack parts of normal adipose tissue development and reprogram primary cells to a liposarcoma-like phenotype. The findings of nuclear FLT1 protein and expression of corresponding ligands in MLS and normal tissues may have implications for tissue homeostasis and tumor development through auto- or intracrine signaling.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22972658', '_score': 152.1562, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Multivariate Analysis [D015999:minor]', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [D009364:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/prevention & control [Q000517:major]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]', 'Proportional Hazards Models [D016016:minor]', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant [D018714:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Risk Factors [D012307:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:major]', 'Time Factors [D013997:minor]', 'Torso [D060726:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Extremities [D005121:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate [D053208:minor]'], 'text': 'Surgery quality and tumor status impact on survival and local control of resectable liposarcomas of extremities or the trunk wall.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: The 5-year survival rates for localized liposarcomas reportedly vary from 75% to 91% with histologic grade as the most important prognostic factor. However, it is unclear which other factors, including the initial surgery quality and recurrent tumors, influence survival in localized liposarcomas (LPS).\n\nQUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We analyzed factors (including AJCC staging system) influencing survival and local control of resectable LPS of the extremities/trunk wall and the impact of surgery quality and tumor status and type of disease recurrences according to pathological subtype.\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients with localized LPS: 110 were treated for primary tumors, 50 for recurrent tumors, and 21 for wide scar resection after unplanned nonradical resection. We determined survival rates and examined factors influencing survival. The minimum followup was 4 months (median, 52 months; range, 4-168 months).\n\nRESULTS: Five-year disease-specific (DSS), disease-free (DFS), and local relapse-free survival (LRFS) rates were: 80%, 58%, and 75%, respectively. Five-year local relapse-free survival rates for primary versus clinically recurrent tumor versus scar after nonradical resection were: 86.1%, 52.1%, and 73.3%, respectively. The following were independent negative prognostic factors for DSS (AJCC Stage ≥ IIb), DFS (Grade 3; clinical recurrence; skin infiltration), and LRFS (clinical recurrence; R1 resection). An unplanned excision, although influencing local relapse-free survival, had no impact on disease-specific survival (calculated from date of first excision 5-year rate of 80%, considering impact of combined treatment of clinical recurrence/scar).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirmed the value of AJCC staging for predicting disease-specific survival in extremity/trunk wall LPS. Radical reresection of scar after nonradical primary tumor resection (+ radiotherapy) seems to improve disease-free and local relapse-free survival in liposarcomas.

Metastatic risk is higher with an increased round cell component and has been linked to aberrations involving the IGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway. These molecular insights have yet to translate to targeted therapies, and the lack of experimental models is a major hindrance. We describe the initial in-depth characterization of a new cell line (DL-221) and establishment of a mouse xenograft model. The cell line DL-221 was derived from a metastatic pleural lesion showing myxoid and round cell histology. This newly established cell line was characterized for phenotypic properties and molecular cytogenetic profile, using PCR, COBRA-FISH, and western blot. Next-generation whole-exome sequencing was performed to further characterize the cell line and the parent tumor. NOD-SCID-IL2R gamma knockout mice were xenograft hosts. DL-221 cells grew an adhering monolayer and COBRA-FISH showed an aneuploid karyotype with t(12;16)(q13;p11) and several other rearrangements; RT-PCR demonstrated a FUS-DDIT3 fusion transcript type 1. Both the cell line and the original tumor harbored a TP53 compound heterozygous mutation in exon 4 and 7, and were wild-type for PIK3CA. Moreover, among the 1254 variants called by whole-exome sequencing, there was 77% concordance between the cell line and parent tumor. The recently described hotspot mutation in the TERT promoter region in myxoid liposarcomas was also found at C228T in DL-221. Xenografts suitable for additional preclinical studies were successfully established in mice after subcutaneous injection. The established DL-221 cell line is the only published available myxoid liposarcoma cell line that underwent spontaneous immortalization, without requiring SV40 transformation.

Selinexor is an oral, selective inhibitor of nuclear export that specifically blocks XPO1, leading to the nuclear accumulation and re-activation of tumor suppressor proteins and growth modulators. Selinexor demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in liposarcoma (LPS) cell line and murine models. Sarcoma patients received selinexor in two Phase 1 studies, resulting in stable disease in 14/18 (78%) of patients with advanced LPS; notably, 6 of these had stable disease  4 months. Tumor reduction of 2-23% was noted in 14 patients. There were no clinically significant cumulative toxicities. Hence, we designed a Phase 2/3 multi-center, randomized, double blind study to assess whether selinexor can improve progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with advanced unresectable DDLS compared to placebo.

Methods: Since September 2002, 32 patients with recurrent or advanced myxoid liposarcoma received T at our institution within an expanded access program. We report herein 8 patients who received T for a median of 10 cycles (range 5-15) prior to discontinuation. We used RECIST criteria to classify patient response to therapy. During the initial administration of T, a CR had been observed in 2 patients, a PR in 3 patients, SD in 2 patients, and one had had tumor shrinkage but did not meet RECIST definition of PR. The median PFS was 24 months from treatment start, and 14 months (range 9-27) from treatment-end. In 6 of the 8 patients, the treatment had been discontinued in the absence of any evidence of disease: 4 patients had undergone complete surgical resection (R0) of residual disease and 2 patients had achieved a radiological complete response (CR). The other two patients stopped treatment voluntarily, one with a partial response (PR) and one with stable disease (SD). All these patients resumed treatment at the time of progression. Results: Following rechallenge with T, no PD was seen at first assessment, and no patients had to discontinue or reduce the dose due to toxicity. Response rate according to RECIST was 50%. At a median follow up of 7 months (range 2.7-12), the median TTP has not yet been reached. Treatment is still ongoing in 5 patients. Conclusions: Rechallenge with T can be beneficial in some patients with myxoid liposarcoma. If further data confirm this, treatment of progressing patients previously responding to T may include this option. Furthermore, studies on optimization of treatment duration upfront may be worthwhile. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24496921', '_score': 151.11401, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Liposarcoma [D008080:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Neoplasm Metastasis [D009362:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]', 'Palliative Care [D010166:major]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Retroperitoneal Neoplasms [D012186:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/mortality [Q000401:major]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/mortality [Q000401:major]/radiotherapy [Q000532:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Survival Rate [D015996:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Anthracyclines [D018943:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Delivery of Health Care [D003695:major]', 'Disease Progression [D018450:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'France [D005602:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leiomyosarcoma [D007890:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/therapy [Q000628:minor]'], 'text': 'Retroperitoneal sarcomas: patterns of care in advanced stages, prognostic factors and focus on main histological subtypes: a multicenter analysis of the French Sarcoma Group.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Retroperitoneal sarcomas (RPS) are heterogeneous.

The purpose of this nationwide retrospective study was to assess efficacy and safety of using trabectedin in the entire unselected cohort of patients with metastatic sarcoma and to test known, as well as new prognostic factors that may affect overall survival (OS).\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and April 2013, 117 patients were treated with trabectedin for metastatic sarcoma in the three specialized sarcoma centers in Denmark. Known prognostic factors such as age, gender and performance status, the histopathology as well as other new factors such as response to previous chemotherapy and hyponatremia were tested.\n\nRESULTS: Median age was 59 years. Lipo- and leiomysosarcomas (L-sarcomas) represented 43% of the cases and 18% had hyponatremia before the start of trabectedin. The median number of previous lines of chemotherapy was two (range 0-6) and the median number of chemotherapy cycles given before trabectedin was nine (range 0-85). The median number of trabectedin cycles was three (range 1-17). The median OS for the whole cohort was seven months. Poor performance status, non-L-sarcomas, and hyponatremia were statistically significant adverse prognostic factors with median survival of: 4, 5, and 2 months compared to 9, 12 and 13 months, respectively. Moreover, having achieved clinical benefit [complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)] from previous chemotherapy was a favorable prognostic factor for response to trabectedin.

Whereas this LGI was initially thought to be mainly attributed to macrophage activation, it is now known that pre-adipocytes and adipocytes secrete several adipokines including IL-6 and participate to LGI and associated pathologies. In macrophages, HMGB1 is a nuclear yet secreted protein and acts as a cytokine to drive the production of inflammatory molecules through RAGE and TLR2/4. In this paper we tested the secretion of HMGB1 and the auto- and paracrine contribution to fat inflammation using the human preadipocyte cell line SW872 as a model.

In a selected specific, SOX2 is uniformly expressed in synovial sarcoma. Embryonic pathways preferentially used in stem cell such as Hippo, Hedgehog, and Wnt dominate in FOXM1 stoichiometry to alter rates of FOXM1 production or degradation. In undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, liposarcoma, and fibrosarcoma, dysregulation of the Hippo pathway increases expression of the effector co-transcriptional activator Yes-Associated Protein (YAP).

Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were found to differ significantly between subtypes (P < 0·001 for both DMFS and DSS), with the worst outcomes in patients with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (5-year survival rate: 56·8 (95 per cent c.i. 52·5 to 61·1) per cent for DMFS; 60·1 (55·6 to 64·6) per cent for DSS). However, on multivariable analysis, histological subtype was not found to be independently prognostic for LRFS, DMFS or DSS. Metastatic disease developed in 149 patients, with the lungs being the most common site of first metastasis (120 patients, 80·5 per cent). The site of first metastasis differed between subtypes, with extrapulmonary metastases predominant in myxoid liposarcoma (11 of 13 patients; P < 0·001).\n\nCONCLUSION: Although histological subtype was not found to be an independent prognostic factor for oncological outcomes, the site of first metastasis differed significantly between subtypes.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23661254', '_score': 141.17015, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator [D014568:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Extracellular Matrix [D005109:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 [D020778:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 [D020780:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors [D061965:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2 [D019716:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]'], 'text': 'Modulation of u-PA, MMPs and their inhibitors by a novel nutrient mixture in adult human sarcoma cell lines.\n\n\nAdult sarcomas are highly aggressive tumors that are characterized by high levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 secretions that degrade the ECM and basement membrane, allowing cancer cells to spread to distal organs. Proteases play a key role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by digesting the basement membrane and ECM components. Strong clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates association of elevated levels of u-PA and MMPs with cancer progression, metastasis and shortened patient survival. MMP activities are regulated by specific tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Our main objective was to study the effect of a nutrient mixture (NM) on the activity of u-PA, MMPs and TIMPs in various human adult sarcomas. Human fibrosarcoma (HT-1080), chondrosarcoma (SW-1353), liposarcoma (SW-872), synovial sarcoma (SW-982) and uterine leimyosarcoma (SK-UT-1) cell lines (ATCC) were cultured in their respective media and treated at confluence with NM at 0, 50, 100, 250, 500 and 1,000 µg/ml. Analysis of u-PA activity was carried out by fibrin zymography, MMPs by gelatinase zymography and TIMPs by reverse zymography. Fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma cancer cell lines expressed u-PA, which was inhibited by NM in a dose-dependent manner. However, no bands corresponding to u-PA were detected for synovial sarcoma cells. On gelatinase zymography, fibrosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma showed bands corresponding to MMP-2 and MMP-9 with enhancement of MMP-9 with PMA (100 ng/ml) treatment. Uterine leiomyosarcoma showed strong bands corresponding to inactive and active MMP-9 and a faint band corresponding to MMP-9 dimer induced with PMA treatment, but no MMP-2 band. NM inhibited their expression in a dose-dependent manner. Activity of TIMPs was upregulated by NM in all cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis revealed a positive correlation between u-PA and MMPs and a negative correlation between u-PA/MMPs and TIMPs.

Intriguingly, we have also encountered this same phenomenon in myxoid liposarcomas exposed to various combinations of neoadjuvant doxorubicin and ifosfamide systemic chemotherapy with preoperative radiation, where the pathological effects have been less characterized. We examined the histological changes, including adipocytic maturation, associated with this treatment in patients with myxoid liposarcoma and evaluated for prognostic significance.\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-two patients were identified with histologically confirmed myxoid liposarcomas (9 with variable hypercellular areas) who were treated with neoadjuvant doxorubicin (75-90 mg/m2/continous infusion over 72h every 3 week) and ifosfamide (2.5 g/m2 daily x 4 every 3 weeks) for 4-6 cycles. Twenty-one patients received pre-operative radiation including 5 with concurrent gemcitabine. Pre- and post-treatment MRI studies were compared for changes in tumor area, fat content and contrast uptake, with the latter two estimated as: none, <25%, 25-49% and >50%. Post-treatment specimens were evaluated for hyalinization, necrosis and adipocytic maturation. Clinical follow-up was obtained.\n\nRESULTS: Median age was 45 (26-72) years with a median tumor size of 11 (2-18) cm. All occurred in the lower extremities except for one case in the neck. As is common in myxoid liposarcoma, all had extensive treatment changes (>90%) with extensive hyalinization (n = 16; >90%) or prominent adipocytic maturation (n = 6; >50%) including 2 cases composed almost entirely of mature-appearing adipose tissue. Variable necrosis was identified (5-30%). MRI revealed a decrease in tumor area in all but one tumor (median, 65%), an increase in fat content in 7 tumors (n = 2, >50%;n = 2, 25-50%;n = 3,<25%), and a decrease in contrast enhancement in most tumors (n = 5, >50%; n = 9, 25-49%; n = 7, <25%). Median follow-up was 57 (12-96) months with 17 alive with no disease/metastases, 3 alive with disease and 2 dead of disease. Six patients developed metastases with median interval of 26 (22-51) months post resection. Four of 6 tumors with increased adipocytic maturation >50% on histology had increased fat detected by MRI (>25%). All 6 are alive but 2 developed metastases. In the remaining patients, 4 developed metastases with 14 alive and 2 dead of disease.\n\nCONCLUSION: Myxoid liposarcoma exposed to neoadjuvant doxorubicin and ifosfamide and pre-operative radiation can have prominent adipocytic maturation similar to trabectedin treatment. Myxoid liposarcomas exhibit extensive treatment changes with prominent hyalinization being the most common histological change. Despite this, patients develop metastases regardless of adipocytic maturation.

We recently reported a series of 160 sarcomas with complex genomics such as leiomyosarcomas, myxofibrosarcomas, pleomorphic liposarcomas/rhabdomyosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. These tumors present with a frequent loss of chromosome 10 region encompassing the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. In the present study, we assessed PTEN genomic level and protein expression in this large series of sarcomas with complex genomics, as well as activation of downstream pathways. PTEN partial genomic loss was observed in only 46% of tumors, especially in well-differentiated leiomyosarcomas, whereas up to 68% of these tumors demonstrate a loss of protein expression on western blot analysis. Specific discrepancies in PTEN immunohistochemical results suggested bias in this latter technique. PTEN mutations were rare, with only 4 point mutations in the 65 samples studied. Subsequent activation of AKT and mTOR pathways was only observed in 2 out of 3 of PTEN-deleted tumors. On the other hand, RICTOR, a major component of the mTOR complex 2, was significantly overexpressed in well-differentiated leiomyosarcomas. These results, confirmed on tissue micro-array immunohistochemical analysis of 459 sarcomas, could suggest a link between RICTOR overexpression and leiomyosarcomas oncogenesis.

FUS has recently been shown to be recruited by noncoding RNAs to the regulatory regions of target genes such as cyclin D1, in which it represses transcription by disrupting complex formation. Here we show that FUS has some characteristics of a putative tumor suppressor, as its overexpression promoted growth inhibition and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, whereas its knockdown increased cell proliferation. This effect was reproducible in vivo, such that increasing FUS levels in tumor xenografts led to dramatic tumor regression. Furthermore, FUS promoted conditions that favored cell-cycle arrest by reducing the levels of proliferative factors such as cyclin D1 and Cdk6 and by increasing levels of the antiproliferative Cdk inhibitor p27. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that FUS expression is inversely correlated with Gleason grade, demonstrating that patients with high levels of FUS survived longer and were less likely to have bone metastases, suggesting that loss of FUS expression may contribute to cancer progression.

Methods: Helical tomotherapy was used for pre-operative RT. Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and main organs at risk were systematically delineated with the surgeon. Surgery was planned 4 to 8 weeks after RT. Inclusion criteria were operable, biopsy-proven, retroperitoneal liposarcomas. Toxicity was graded according to CTCAE V3.0. Overall survival (OS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Due to competing risks, we estimated the cumulative incidence of loco-regional relapse; 95% confidence intervals are reported [95%CI]. Results:Patients:From 04/2009 to 09/2013, 48 patients were included. Mean age: 62 years (y) (36 to 82). All but 1 patient were OMS  2. Histological types were 20 well differentiated (WDLS) and 28 dedifferentiated liposarcomas. Mean CTV was 2954 cc. Treatment:1 patient did not have surgery. Dosimetric constraints were respected.

Cumulative incidence of loco-regional relapse at 3 and 5 y was 17% [8%; 29%] and 31% [16%; 47%] respectively.

However, the feasibility of radiotherapy in combination with this treatment modality has not been established.\n\nMETHODS: Fifteen patients with irresectable soft tissue tumors of the limb underwent ILP with TNF alpha, +/-IFN gamma, and melphalan. Three groups could be distinguished with respect to the role of radiotherapy. In nine patients, the residual tumor could be resected after ILP, and this was followed by radiotherapy with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (2 Gy/day). In one patient with aggressive fibromatosis, ILP was followed by radiotherapy without tumor resection (Group I). In two patients who underwent ILP for recurrent sarcoma, the primary tumor had been treated before by resection and radiotherapy (60 Gy) (Group II). In three patients whose tumors remained irresectable after ILP, radiotherapy was applied later in the course of disease for local palliation (Group III).\n\nRESULTS: In Group I, healing of the resection wound was markedly delayed in four patients, with soft tissue necrosis and infection necessitating amputation in two of them. Following completion of radiotherapy, persistent lymphoceles were encountered in two patients. Radiotherapy-induced fibrosis was encountered in five patients, resulting in a mild limb malfunction in two. Three-patients developed mild edema during radiotherapy. Tumor-associated neuropathy was aggravated by ILP in three patients causing severely disabling motor deficits and limb contractures in two of them. In Group II, ILP did not cause any local problem in the heavily irradiated areas. In Group III, pre-existing limb edema was increased after a total palliative dose of 20 Gy in one patient. Another patient, who had been re-operated for arterial thrombosis immediately after ILP, developed occlusion of the brachial artery 4 months after completion of palliative radiotherapy (36 Gy in 6 Gy fractions).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with irresectable soft tissue tumors, multimodality treatment using ILP with TNF alpha +/- IFN gamma and melphalan, tumor resection, and postoperative high-dose radiotherapy is associated with a considerable risk of tissue necrosis and impaired healing. This risk should be weighed against a possible benefit from radiotherapy in local tumor control.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '26391479', '_score': 137.07309, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'TERT promoter mutations in soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: Oncogenic hotspot mutations in the promoter region of the TERT gene have been identified in several cancer types as being associated with a worse outcome.

The patients were all evaluated by lymphography. The investigation included both patients who had not yet been treated and patients with suspected or confirmed metastases. All tumour diagnoses were confirmed microscopically. The findings as regards dissemination were based on clinical examinations, laboratory tests, roentgen examinations and lymphographies. In some cases, lymph node biopsies and surgical observations were also used. A total of 151 lymphographies were performed and 281 follow-up films taken. Preoperative lymphography was performed using the technique introduced by Kinmonth. For postoperative lymphography on the stumps of amputated extremities, two simple but useful methods were developed, which are presented here. Changes in the lymphographic appearance of lymph node metastases, the occurrence of new metastases, and the results of treatment were assessed by survey films and repeat lymphography. The generally accepted criteria for metastasis were used as a basis for the analysis of the lymphographic findings. The results may be summarized as follows: 1. Incidence of lymphatic dissemination. Different sarcomas varied greatly in their clinical course, including the frequency of dissemination. The lymphatic involvement in the metastatic cases was as follows: Bone sarcomas: 16 out of 28 (Table 10); of these, 13 were to regional lymph nodes, 8 to distant nodes and 5 to both (Table 14). Soft tissue sarcomas: 24 out of 40 (Table 11). All 24 had metastases in regional nodes, and 8 in distant nodes as well (Table 15). The highest frequencies of lymphatic spread in the different metastasized tumours were found to be: Bone sarcomas: reticulosarcoma 100%, Ewing's sarcoma 50%, osteosarcoma 47%. Soft tissue sarcomas: rhabdomyosarcoma 100%, synovial sarcoma 80%, neurogenic sarcoma 78%, leiomyosarcoma 67%. 2. Time-relation between lymphatic and haematogenic dissemination; The tendency to metastasize first via the lymphatics or via the blood vessels varied. Half of the cases of Ewing's sarcoma and reticulosarcoma had evidence of lymphatic spread before blood-borne metastases were detected. In the osteosarcoma cases, however, lymphatic dissemination was always preceded by haematogenic spread (Table 12). In synovial sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and neurogenic sarcoma, the first dissemination was more frequently lymphatic than haematogenic (Table 13). 3. Possible existence of special lymphographic features of sarcoma metastases. Only reticulosarcoma displayed special characteristics. The lymph node metastases of reticulosarcoma of bone had lymphographic appearances similar to those found in reticulosarcoma of soft tissue or lymph node origin (Fig. 12). The lymph node metastases of other primary bone and soft tissue sarcomas had no specific lymphographic features and were indistinguishable from carcinomatous metastases (Figs 7, 9, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23). 4..."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27615729', '_score': 136.6365, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Efficacy of trabectedin for the treatment of liposarcoma.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: Trabectedin (ET-743) is a synthetic marine derived alkylating agent, extracted originally from a Caribbean Sea sponge.

Recent studies have suggested that MLPS expresses high levels of adipophilin and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), which are correlated with adipogenesis and metastasis. In addition, the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (EWSR1-DDIT3) fusion transcript, recently identified in MLPS, was shown to selectively repress the osteoblastic transcription in multipotent mesenchymal cells. The present study reported a rare case of MLPS with metastasis in fat-bearing areas, including the bones, epidural region, orbits and abdominal cavity, while the lungs were not involved. Bone metastasis was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and proven by histology. However, bone scanning lacked sufficient sensitivity to detect the bone metastasis. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that molecular adipophilin and molecular CXCR4 may contribute to the fat-bearing area metastasis pattern.

Trabectedin was able to remove FUS-CHOP type I, II and III from its own target genes but it causes adipocytic maturation and tumor regression only in type I and II, not in type III MRCLS (Di Giandomenico et al, Oncogene, 2014 Oct 30; 33(44): 5201-10). Pioglitazone is a PPARgamma agonist with pro-differentiation effects in different cancer types included liposarcomas (Tontonoz P. et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jan 7;94(1): 237-41).The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of trabectedin with pioglitazone in type III myxoid liposarcoma xenografts.ML006 and ML004 type III MRCLS xenografts mice were treated with trabectedin 0.15 mg/kg iv every seven days for three times or pioglitazone 150 mg/kg po daily for 28 days or with their combination. For antitumor activity evaluation, tumor growth was measured with a caliper and the tumor weights (1 mm3 = 1 mg) were calculated with the formula: length  (width)2/2. Fifteen days after the last dose of trabectedin and 4 h after the last dose of pioglitazone tumors were collected from a separate group of mice to perform histological and molecular analyses.Trabectedin and pioglitazone as single agents have a comparable antitumor activity on these models with T/C around 40-50% with no tumor regression observed. In the combination groups an impressive and long lasting tumor regression was observed in ML 006 xenograft, with an observed optimal T/C of 17%. In ML004 MRCLS model the combination of trabectedin and pioglitazone induced a minimal regression followed by a long lasting tumor stabilization, resulting in a T/C of 23%. The histological analyses showed adipocytic maturation in tumors treated with pioglitazone alone or in combination but not in samples from mice treated with trabectedin alone.In conclusion, the combination of trabectedin with pioglitazone was able to induce tumor regression and adipocytic maturation in type III myxoid liposarcoma xenografts that were only marginally sensitive to trabectedin alone. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, gene expression profile and Western Blot analysis are on-going to unravel the molecular mechanism behind the potentiation of the antitumor efficacy observed with this combination.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '11803277', '_score': 132.74629, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Biomarkers, Tumor [D014408:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Nevus, Pigmented [D009508:minor]/congenital [Q000151:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma [D012208:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'S100 Proteins [D009418:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Skin Neoplasms [D012878:minor]/congenital [Q000151:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Desmin [D003893:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Fatal Outcome [D017809:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques [D007124:minor]', 'Myoglobin [D009211:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary [D016609:minor]'], 'text': 'Rhabdomyosarcoma arising in a congenital melanocytic nevus.\n\n\nA variety of malignancies have been reported to arise within congenital melanocytic nevi, most commonly malignant melanoma, but rarely rhabdomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor as well.

We previously identified that TLS was associated with protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), and four arginine residues within TLS (R216, R218, R242 and R394) were consistently dimethylated. Protein arginine methylation is involved in various cellular events such as signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: To understand the biological role of arginine methylation of RNA-binding protein, we prepared and characterized a mouse monoclonal antibody against asymmetric dimethylarginine of TLS. By cloning and screening, one stable hybridoma cell clone (2B12) producing anti-asymmetric dimethylated TLS on R216 and R218 antibody was established. The monoclonal antibody 2B12 is specific for the asymmetrically dimethylated arginine peptide and does not react with the same peptide sequence containing unmodified and symmetrically dimethylated arginine residues by dot-blot analysis. 2B12 was also validated GST tagged TLS with PRMT1 by in vitro arginine methylation assays. Since methylated TLS in HeLa cells and mouse and human brain protein extracts was immunoprecipitated with 2B12, we performed RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assays using HeLa cell lysate and this antibody. We demonstrated that the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcribed from cyclin D1 promoter binds methylated TLS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: A monoclonal antibody that is capable of detecting the methylarginine status of TLS will facilitate the molecular and cellular analysis of transcriptional regulation by lncRNA through methylated TLS, and can be used as a favorable tool for clinical diagnosis of ALS caused by TLS dysregulation.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '10422682', '_score': 132.10468, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adenocarcinoma [D000230:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Microscopy, Electron [D008854:minor]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]', 'Ovarian Neoplasms [D010051:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]', 'Translocation, Genetic [D014178:minor]', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/ultrastructure [Q000648:minor]', 'Apoptosis [D017209:minor]', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8 [D002898:minor]', 'Culture Media, Conditioned [D017077:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'DNA, Neoplasm [D004273:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor [D016147:minor]', 'Genes, myc [D016259:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Establishment and growth regulation of a novel ovarian cancer cell line from a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma: proposal for a new treatment.\n\n\nA continuously growing cultured cell line has been obtained in vitro, starting from a specimen of ascites fluid obtained from a patient with ovarian cancer, in whom a poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma was diagnosed.

We established five grades of relationship between tumors and superficial fascia and analyzed the probability of the lesions in each group being malignant. Group 1 tumors did not contact the fascia; group 2 lesions contacted it slightly, with acute angles between the tumor and the fascia; group 3 lesions had wider contact with larger acute or right angles; group 4 tumors had even wider contact with obtuse angles with the fascia; and group 5 was composed of lesions that crossed the superficial fascia.\n\nRESULTS: The probability of a subcutaneous lesion that crosses the superficial fascia being malignant was 6.88 times greater than for lesions that did not cross the fascia.

Over 50 sarcomas subtypes have been classified and many have very limited treatment options. Chemotherapies such as doxorubicin, dacarbazine and gemcitabine have had very low response rates. Two of the most common subtypes of sarcomas are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, also referred to as the L-sarcomas. Trabectedin, a marine derived compound from the sea sponge, Ecteinascidia turbinate, has recently been approved for the treatment of L-sarcomas which has shown a modest effect over common therapies. As a DNA damaging agent, we hypothesized that trabectedin would induce a G2 cell cycle arrest and subsequent inhibition of Wee1 would abrogate this cell cycle checkpoint and induce apoptosis. We therefore examined the effects of trabectedin followed by AZD1775, a Wee1 inhibitor, in a panel of 6 sarcoma cell lines including liposarcoma (LS141, DDLS) and leiomyosarcoma (SK-LMS, SK-UT1, SK-UT1b). IC50s concentrations of trabectedin were determined to be between 0.5 to 2nM, while IC50s for AZD1775 were in the range of 100-200 nM. In vitro results have shown an enhanced inhibition of cell viability with combination treatment in all cell lines at concentrations of 1nM trabectedin for 24hrs followed by 100nM AZD1775 for 48hrs. We also examined biochemical effects with sequential drug treatment (24hrs trabectedin followed by 24hrs AZD1775) which presented an increase of cyclin A1 and cyclin B1 indicative of G2 cell cycle arrest along with increase of phospho-H2AX, indicative of DNA damage by trabectedin, while subsequent treatment with the Wee1 inhibitor showed decrease of phosphorylation of CDC2 (Tyr15). Flow cytometric analysis indicated G2/M cell cycle arrest with trabectedin and abrogation of G2/M with AZD1775. These observations correlated with enhanced apoptosis as measured by biochemical PARP cleavage and DNA content (sub-G1 population).

Therapeutic outcome of LS is mainly determined by the efficiency of surgery as a high tendency for local relapse is seen. Chemo- and radiotherapy represent further therapeutic options, however, specifically targeted therapies are currently not available. The oncoprotein SRC is a tyrosine kinase, which has been shown to be activated in a variety of human cancers. SRC activation plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and motility. In this work we analyzed LS biopsies comprising the main different subgroups, i.e. myxoid (MLS), well/dedifferentiated (WDLS/DDLS) and pleomorphic (PLS) LS and corresponding cell lines regarding SRC activation and studied the biological effects of SRC inhibition. Based on data derived from phospho-kinase screens in LS cells, immunhistochemical stainings of (Tyr416)-phosphorylated (p)-SRC were performed in primary LS biopsies. LS cell lines treated with the SRC inhibitor dasatinib were analyzed for phosphorylation of SRC and its downstream signaling molecules, cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. Furthermore, synergistic effects of simultaneous treatments with dasatinib and conventional cytotoxic drugs were investigated. Particularly WDLS/DDLS and MLS tumor cells showed a significant expression of p-SRC. In LS cell lines, inhibition of SRC with dasatinib resulted in a substantially impaired cellular growth accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of SRC and its downstream targets. Flow cytometric analysis showed that effects of SRC inhibition were due to an increase in apoptosis (cleaved PARP(Asp 214)) and a decrease of cellular proliferation (phospho-(Ser10) Histone H3). Scratch and Boyden chamber assays indicated a diminished migratory potential of the tumor cells due to SRC inactivation. Simultaneous treatment of liposarcoma cell lines with dasatinib and chemotherapeutic drugs resulted in additive effects. Our data suggest that SRC kinase activation represents an important biological feature of LS which might be successfully addressed in targeted therapeutic approaches.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27237367', '_score': 129.87221, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Oncogene mutation profiling reveals poor prognosis associated with FGFR1/3 mutation in liposarcoma.\n\n\nLiposarcoma (LPS) is one of the most prevalent soft tissue sarcomas.

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the ideal surgical procedures for treating RL.\n\nMETHODS: RL patients treated at our institute between 2003 and 2013 amounted to 10.

RL was well-differentiated in 6 patients and dedifferentiated in 4. We analyzed the overall survival of 10 patients, and the relapse free survival of the operated 9 patients.

In translocation-associated sarcomas, the presence of the fusion transcript can be detected in peripheral blood by RT-PCR. However, sarcoma cells have never been directly visualized in peripheral blood due to the absence of specific immunocytochemical markers. Methods: We developed a novel method to examine large numbers of peripheral blood cells for the presence of sarcoma-associated genetic changes. Using an IRB-approved biospecimen collection protocol, peripheral blood was collected from 20 patients with translocation-associated sarcomas or well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcomas (WD/DD LS), which are characterized by MDM2 amplification. In this exploratory phase, the analysis was limited to patients with high burden of disease, evidence of disease progression or recurrence. Immuno-FISH was performed using CD45 immunostaining to identify hematopoietic cells and the corresponding FISH probe, either a break-apart probe (SYT, DDIT3) or MDM2 probe to detect amplification. Results: MDM2-amplified cells were detected in a subset of WD/DD LS peripheral blood samples, while translocation-positive cells were detected in samples of synovial sarcoma (using the SYT breakapart probe) and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (using the DDIT3 breakapart probe). Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first report of direct visualization of sarcoma cells in peripheral blood using whole-blood FISH analysis. We are currently characterizing these cells morphologically and immunocytochemically. In addition, we are developing tools necessary to perform quantitative analysis of circulating tumor cell frequencies in peripheral blood samples, to begin to establish whether the levels of circulating tumor cells correlate with tumor burden and response to therapy. This method may be applicable to other tumors where defined genetic lesions exist that are amenable to FISH analysis. The goal is to use such genotype-based analysis to explore the phenotypic diversity of circulating tumor cells. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '18509338', '_score': 128.09631, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Allosteric Regulation [D000494:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Oligonucleotides [D009841:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic [D011401:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'RNA, Untranslated [D022661:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS [D034702:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Transcription, Genetic [D014158:major]', 'CREB-Binding Protein [D050882:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cell Line [D002460:minor]', 'Consensus Sequence [D016384:minor]', 'Cyclin D1 [D019938:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'DNA Damage [D004249:minor]', 'Down-Regulation [D015536:major]', 'HeLa Cells [D006367:minor]', 'Histone Acetyltransferases [D051548:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]'], 'text': "Induced ncRNAs allosterically modify RNA-binding proteins in cis to inhibit transcription.\n\n\nWith the recent recognition of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) flanking many genes, a central issue is to obtain a full understanding of their potential roles in regulated gene transcription programmes, possibly through different mechanisms. Here we show that an RNA-binding protein, TLS (for translocated in liposarcoma), serves as a key transcriptional regulatory sensor of DNA damage signals that, on the basis of its allosteric modulation by RNA, specifically binds to and inhibits CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities on a repressed gene target, cyclin D1 (CCND1) in human cell lines. Recruitment of TLS to the CCND1 promoter to cause gene-specific repression is directed by single-stranded, low-copy-number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5' regulatory regions of CCND1 that are induced in response to DNA damage signals. Our data suggest that signal-induced ncRNAs localized to regulatory regions of transcription units can act cooperatively as selective ligands, recruiting and modulating the activities of distinct classes of RNA-binding co-regulators in response to specific signals, providing an unexpected ncRNA/RNA-binding protein-based strategy to integrate transcriptional programmes."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '24321521', '_score': 127.49748, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt [D051057:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Transcriptome [D059467:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Enzyme Activation [D004789:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Gene Dosage [D018628:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic [D015971:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic [D015972:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Significance of Akt activation and AKT gene increases in soft tissue tumors.\n\n\nTo clarify the aberrations of AKT genes, their protein products and clinicopathologic significance in bone and soft tissue tumors, expression profiles of total Akt, its isoforms and activated Akt, and increases in copy number of AKT1/AKT2 genes were examined.

To determine whether the podoplanin (D2-40) antibody may be useful for the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, 125 cases, including 4 kinds of benign tumors, 15 kinds of malignant tumors and 3 kinds of tumor-like lesions were immunostained using the D2-40 antibody.

MicroRNAs are one of the well-identified small ncRNAs, but occupy merely a fraction of ncRNAs. Long (large) ncRNAs are emerging as a novel class of ncRNAs, but knowledge of these ncRNAs is far less accumulated. Long ncRNAs are tentatively classified as an ncRNA species containing more than 200 nucleotides. Recently, a long promoter-associated ncRNA (pncRNA) has been identified to be transcribed from the cyclin D1 promoter upon induction by genotoxic factors like ionizing-irradiation. The cyclin D1 pncRNA is specifically bound with an RNA-binding protein TLS (Translocated in liposarcoma) and exerts transcriptional repression through histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitory activity. Analysis of TLS and the pncRNAs could provide a model for elucidating their roles inregulation of mammalian transcriptional programs. The pncRNA binding to TLS turns out to be an essential event for the HAT inhibitory activity. A key consensus sequence of the pncRNA is composed of GGUG, while not every RNA sequence bearing GGUG is targeted by TLS, suggesting that a secondary structure of the GGUG-bearing RNAs is also involved in recognition by TLS. Taken together, TLS is a unique mediator between signals of the long ncRNAs and transcription, suggesting that RNA networking functions in living cells.(1-3).'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_170162-176', '_score': 126.207245, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: M1-polarized macrophages as predictor of poor response to trabectedin treatment in myxoid liposarcoma.\n\n\n\nBackground: Myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) represents a specific subtype of liposarcoma, one of the most common malignant soft tissue tumors affecting adults. Trabectedin is a DNA-binding agent interfering with gene transcription, regulation, and DNA repair machinery and is able to induce cell cycle perturbation. Although an high sensitivity of MLS to trabectedin has been reported, patients become resistant to the drug. A well-established model to study this phenomenon is the trabectedin-resistant (ET) 402-91 cell line and its counterpart wild type (WT). The aim of this study is to understand the key role of M1/M2 polarized macrophages in the acquisition and selection of trabectedin-resistant phenotype in MLS. Methods: WT and ET 402-91 cell lines were cultured according to standard protocol. Green Fluorescent (GFP) WT 402-91 and Red Fluorescent (RFP) ET 402-91 cell lines were obtained by stable transfections with lentiviral particles. Macrophages were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes and polarized in M1/M2 using LPS and interleukin-4 respectively. Co-culture experiments between MLS cell lines and M1/M2 macrophages were performed using transwell system. Results: M1 macrophages inhibits WT 402-91 proliferation after 96 hours of co-culture compared to control (single culture) and to WT 402-91-M2 co-culture. Conversely, M1 and M2 macrophages have no impact on proliferation of ET 402-91 cells. Population doubling time (PDT) of M1 co-cultured WT 402-91 is 5.11 hours higher than PDT of M1 co-cultured ET 402-91 (28.97 hours vs 23.86; P = 0.036). This data is confirmed co-culturing GFP+ WT 402-91 and RFP+ ET 402-91, cell-to-cell contact, under influence of M1/M2 macrophages in transwell; indeed RFP+ ET 402-91 percentage become progressively higher than GFP+ WT 402-91 after 96 hours in presence of M1 macrophages compared to M2 macrophages (75%-35% vs 52%-48%; P = 0.04). Conclusions: These data show that the presence of M1 macrophages could promote the selection of trabectedin-resistant phenotype in MLS. Moreover our findings suggest that M1 infiltrating macrophages may predict a poor response to trabectedin treatment in MLS patients but further analyses are warranted to confirm this hypothesis. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '18620545', '_score': 125.87628, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Amino Acid Sequence [D000595:minor]', 'Mass Spectrometry [D013058:minor]', 'Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]', 'Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]', 'Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases [D017346:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS [D034702:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins [D011993:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid [D017386:minor]', 'Serine [D012694:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins [D025521:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Ultraviolet Rays [D014466:minor]', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins [D064007:minor]', 'Cell Cycle Proteins [D018797:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Cell Line [D002460:minor]', 'Chromatography, Affinity [D002846:minor]', 'DNA Damage [D004249:minor]', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase [D051747:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': "Identification and characterization of FUS/TLS as a new target of ATM.\n\n\nATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM- and Rad3-related) and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), important regulators of genome stability, belong to the PIKK (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-like kinase) family of protein kinases.

The residues in FUS that are phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo were identified, and phospho-specific antibodies were generated to demonstrate that FUS becomes phosphorylated at Ser(42) in vivo, primarily in response to agents that cause DSBs (double-strand breaks). DSB-induced FUS phosphorylation in vivo at Ser(42) requires ATM and not DNA-PK.

A valid and reproducible prognostication system is needed to select patients with soft-tissue sarcomas who could benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. This study was conducted to assess the validity and reproducibility of diagnosis of the histologic type, MIB-1 grade, and mitosis grade, as well as of the 3 components of these grading systems. MIB-1 grade is a recently proposed grading system for predicting the prognosis of patients with adult soft-tissue sarcomas on the basis of 3 criteria (tumor differentiation, necrosis, and MIB-1 score) and replaces the mitotic count in the French system with MIB-1 immunohistochemical staining. Four surgical pathologists from 4 institutions who had experience in diagnostic soft-tissue tumor pathology reviewed 130 cases of soft-tissue sarcoma and independently determined histologic type and grade. The validity of histologic diagnosis was measured by sensitivity and specificity, and that of grading was measured by kappa statistics and percentage agreement with the diagnosis of the expert panel at the National Cancer Center, which was defined as a gold standard. Interobserver reproducibility was measured by kappa and by percentage agreement between the diagnoses of the 4 pathologists. The validity of the diagnosis of histologic type was high for synovial sarcoma, small round-cell sarcoma, and liposarcoma (sensitivity 89% to 100%; specificity, 98% to 100%) but low for malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and spindle-cell sarcoma (73% to 75%; 93% to 95%). For the grading, the validity of the MIB-1 grade was substantial (kappa = 0.68; agreement, 79%) and higher than that of the mitosis grade (0.54; 69%). The most valid component was tumor differentiation (kappa = 0.79), followed by tumor necrosis (0.66), MIB-1 score (0.59), and mitotic score (0.37). Interobserver reproducibility of histologic diagnosis was high for small round-cell sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and liposarcoma (kappa = 0.92, 0.90, 0.87; percentage agreement = 99%, 97%, 96%, respectively); for grading, reproducibility was highest for tumor differentiation (0.78; 87%) and second highest for MIB-1 grade (0.68; 79%). We conclude that diagnosis of the type of soft-tissue sarcoma for synovial sarcoma, small round-cell sarcoma, and liposarcoma and the MIB-1 grading system based on tumor differentiation are highly valid and reproducible among Japanese pathologists who are familiar with the grading system, whereas re-evaluation of histologic criteria is essential for other histologic types such as MFH and spindle-cell sarcoma.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19103256', '_score': 125.204285, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells [D012165:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Calcium [D002118:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Cell Line [D002460:minor]', 'Cerebral Cortex [D002540:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Immunoprecipitation [D047468:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS [D034702:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Rats [D051381:minor]', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate [D016194:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/immunology [Q000276:major]', 'Retina [D012160:minor]/cytology [Q000166:major]/metabolism [Q000378:major]'], 'text': 'TLS interaction with NMDA R1 splice variant in retinal ganglion cell line RGC-5.\n\n\nTranslocated in liposarcoma (TLS or FUS) is a multifunctional protein component of the heterogenous ribonuclear complex involved in the splicing of pre-mRNA and the export of fully processed mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Doxorubicin, first reported to have activity in sarcomas 40 years ago, remains the generalizable first-line treatment of choice for many subtypes, with no other drug or combination having shown an overall-survival advantage. Other cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel for angiosarcoma or gemcitabine with docetaxel for leiomyosarcoma, are commonly used for certain histologic subtypes based on relatively small studies. Trabectedin, particularly active against leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma, is approved in many countries worldwide but not yet in the United States or Australia. Newer cytotoxic agents, including ifosfamide derivatives, are in current phase III testing. Although advances is systemic therapy of soft-tissue sarcomas have been hampered by their biologic heterogeneity, this diversity also serves as fertile ground for discovery and validation of targetable molecular drivers. The most notable success in this regard has been the development of small molecule therapies for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Other targets of recent interest include mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) in dedifferentiated liposarcoma and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Molecular therapies that have shown activity in diverse sarcoma populations include mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-R) inhibitors.

Cabozantinib (CABO) is a multi-target inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases including VEGFR, MET, RET, and KIT. We aimed to evaluate the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor effect of CABO alone and in combination with the standard-of-care cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (DOX) in a patient-derived xenograft model of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS).Methods: NMRI nu/nu mice were bilaterally transplanted with human UZLX-STS3 DDLPS tumors, a model originating from a patient with DDLPS. Twenty eight tumor-bearing mice were assigned to 4 groups and treated for three weeks with either vehicle (control), DOX (i.p., 1.2mg/kg/twice per week), CABO (p.o., 30mg/kg/QD) or CABO+DOX (same dose/schedule as for the single agents). Tumor volume was measured three times a week. Mitotic and apoptotic activity were assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and with phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) and cleaved-caspase 3 (CC3) immunostainings. Microvascular density (MVD) was evaluated by counting CD34 positive vessels. Statistics were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U pairs tests. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.Results: A significant delay in tumor growth was observed in CABO and CABO+DOX treated groups as compared to controls (p<0.05) or DOX single agent (p<0.05). Both CABO and CABO+DOX reduced the mitotic activity in comparison with control (38% and 66% decrease, respectively, p<0.005). CABO+DOX showed better antimitotic activity than either single agent DOX or CABO (p<0.005 for both). The CABO-based treatments induced higher apoptotic activity as compared to control (2.1 fold in CABO and 2.4 fold in CABO+DOX, p<0.005). Results were confirmed by pHH3 and CC3 stainings. Furthermore, significantly decreased MVD was observed in the CABO and the combination treated tumors as compared to control (64% and 67% decrease, respectively, p<0.005) and as compared to DOX alone (57% and 61% decrease, respectively, p<0.005).Conclusions: CABO has anti-tumor activity in the UZLX-STS3 DDLPS xenograft model by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis. These in vivo results support ongoing and planned clinical trials with cabozantinib in mesenchymal malignancies.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '10499645', '_score': 121.66278, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Administration, Inhalation [D000280:minor]', 'Lung Neoplasms [D008175:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/secondary [Q000556:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Melanoma [D008545:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/secondary [Q000556:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:major]', 'Paclitaxel [D017239:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/secondary [Q000556:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:major]', 'Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:major]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic [D000972:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:major]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]', 'Disease Models, Animal [D004195:minor]', 'Dog Diseases [D004283:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Dogs [D004285:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/blood [Q000097:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]'], 'text': 'Inhalation chemotherapy for macroscopic primary or metastatic lung tumors: proof of principle using dogs with spontaneously occurring tumors as a model.\n\n\nThis study represents part of an effort to determine the safety and efficacy of inhaled antineoplastic drugs, using pet dogs with spontaneously arising primary and metastatic lung cancers (including sarcoma, carcinoma, and malignant melanoma) as a model.

When expressing Wt, R524S or P525L mutant FUS in photoreceptors, mushroom bodies (MBs) or motor neurons (MNs), transgenic flies show age-dependent progressive neural damages, including axonal loss in MB neurons, morphological changes and functional impairment in MNs. The transgenic flies expressing the hFUS gene recapitulate key features of FUS proteinopathy, representing the first stable animal model for this group of devastating diseases.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25519700', '_score': 119.77765, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adenosine Triphosphate [D000255:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50 [D020128:minor]', 'Mice, Nude [D008819:minor]', 'Multiprotein Complexes [D046912:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Osteosarcoma [D012516:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Phosphorylation [D010766:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors [D047428:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Pyrimidines [D011743:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Sirolimus [D020123:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Substrate Specificity [D013379:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases [D058570:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays [D023041:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Apoptosis [D017209:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Benzoxazoles [D001583:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Proliferation [D049109:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Disease Models, Animal [D004195:minor]', 'Down-Regulation [D015536:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]'], 'text': 'MLN0128, an ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor with potent in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity, as potential therapy for bone and soft-tissue sarcoma.\n\n\nThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that exists in two complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) and integrates extracellular and intracellular signals to act as a master regulator of cell growth, survival, and metabolism.

In vitro, MLN0128 inhibits mTORC1/2 targets in a concentration-dependent fashion and shows striking antiproliferative effect in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Ewing sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, synovial sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and liposarcoma. Unlike rapamycin, MLN0128 inhibits phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and NDRG1 as well as prevents the reactivation of pAKT that occurs via negative feedback release with mTORC1 inhibition alone.

At the 3 mg/kg dosing schedule, MLN0128 treatment results in significantly better tumor growth suppression than rapamycin in RMS and Ewing sarcoma models.

To ascertain the validity of these criteria, we have reviewed our experience with 301 consecutive differentiated lipomatous tumors in which the diagnosis of ALT could not be established on the basis of histologic sections and in which FISH was performed on the basis of the above criteria. The final diagnosis was based on MDM2 amplification status. Given the nature of this study to evaluate difficult lesions, most cases included (74%) were received in consultation. This enhanced our study series for borderline cases, and the data presented may not be generalizable to adipocytic tumors seen outside a subspecialty setting. Of 301 cases, 108 proved to be ALT/WDL (36%). The most common test indication was size >10 cm (n=187), followed by equivocal atypia (n=145), retroperitoneal/pelvic/abdominal location (n=86), recurrence (n=33), and clinical concern (n=12). Of the tumors >10 cm, 68 (36%) proved to be ALT/WDL, whereas the remainder were interpreted as lipoma or its variants (eg, spindle cell or pleomorphic lipoma). The 2 groups did not differ statistically in size, although ALTs consistently occurred in patients above 50 years of age. Of the cases with equivocal atypia, 72 (50%) proved to be ALT/WDL. Those in the retroperitoneum/abdomen/pelvis were ALT/WDL in 30 cases (35%), and those that had recurred were ALT in 18 cases (55%). Recurrence, atypia, and having multiple indications for testing were more common in ALT than in benign lesions (P=0.02, 0.0001, 0.0012, respectively). No ALT/WDL occurred in the hands and feet, and only a single ALT/WDL was superficial (1 ALT/WDL vs. 60 lipoma/spindle cell or pleomorphic lipoma). Small (<10 cm) retroperitoneal tumors without additional features were always benign (n=9). On the basis of our results, FISH testing is recommended for: (1) recurrent lesions; (2) deep extremity lesions that are >10 cm in patients over 50 years of age; (3) in cases with equivocal atypia; (4) in lesions of the retroperitoneum/pelvis/abdomen, and in special clinical situations as directed by treating clinicians. Testing is low yield in superficial lesions, in small extremity lesions without additional indicators for testing, in large extremity lesions without additional features in patients under the age of 50, and in lesions arising in the hands/feet. More evidence is needed regarding testing in small retroperitoneal lesions without additional features.

Many protein-coding genes in the region, such as MDM2 and , have been studied as potential therapeutic targets for LPS treatment, with minimal success. In the amplified region near the MDM2 gene, our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of 75 LPS samples identified frequent amplification of miR-26a-2. Besides being in the amplicon, miR-26a-2 was overexpressed significantly in WDLPS/DDLPS (P<0.001), as well as in myxoid/round cell LPS (MRC) (P<0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overexpression of miR-26a-2 significantly correlated with poor patient survival in both types of LPS (P<0.05 for WDLPS/DDLPS; P<0.001 for MRC). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that miR-26a-2 has an important role in LPS tumorigenesis, regardless of LPS subtypes. Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in three LPS cell lines (SW872, LPS141 and LP6) enhanced the growth and survival of these cells, including faster cell proliferation and migration, enhanced clonogenicity, suppressed adipocyte differentiation and/or resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells using anti-miR-26a-2 resulted in the opposite responses. To explain further the effect of miR-26a-2 overexpression in LPS cells, we performed in silico analysis and identified 93 candidate targets of miR-26a-2. Among these genes, RCBTB1 (regulator of chromosome condensation and BTB domain-containing protein 1) is located at 13q12.3-q14.3, a region of recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in LPS. Indeed, either overexpression or inhibition of RCBTB1 made LPS cells more susceptible or resistant to apoptosis, respectively.

Several studies revealed significant higher EPHB4 expression in malignancies such as prostate and colorectal cancer showing survival advantages for these tumor cells. Therefore we studied the expression of EPHB4 in a total of 46 clinical human specimens of different STS and human fibroblasts. EPHB4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in synovial sarcoma. After targeting EPHB4 in fibrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, liposarcoma and MFH sarcoma cell lines by siRNA or by inhibition of autophosphorylation using the specific EPHB4 kinase inhibitor NVP-BHG712 a decreased proliferation rate/vitality of synovial- and fibrosarcoma cells was observed. Silencing of EPHB4 significantly reduced the transmigration of synovial sarcoma cells towards fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In addition, we assessed the anti-metastatic effect of EPHB4 inhibition in vivo by intraperitoneal administration of the EPHB4 inhibitor in an appropriate sarcoma lung metastasis xenograft model. As result 43% of NVP-BHG712 treated mice (n = 3/7) developed pulmonary metastases whereas all control mice (n = 5) revealed lung metastases. The residual 57% of mice (n = 4/7) showed only small local tumor cell spots. Size measurements of the Vimentin positive area explained significant decrease in lung metastasis formation (p < 0.05) after EPHB4 kinase inhibition.

Classic cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis play an important role in their diagnostic work up.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six cases of soft-tissue sarcoma were reviewed that underwent karyotyping and simultaneous FISH analysis at initial diagnosis. They included 10 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 10 myxoid liposarcomas, and 14 synovial sarcomas. Six tumors were investigated for EWSR1 rearrangement. Six high-grade miscellaneous sarcomas were also examined.\n\nRESULTS: The dedifferentiated liposarcoma had complex karyotypes and MDM2 amplification by FISH, and of these, 5 tumors with myxoid changes also had complex signals for DDIT3. All but 4 myxoid liposarcomas had complex karyotypes, in addition to the characteristic translocation. FISH analysis displayed DD1T3 rearrangement. All synovial sarcomas except 1 recurrence had a t(X;18) translocation by karyotyping and FISH. The EWSR1 rearrangement was present in all extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, atypical Ewing sarcoma, and a clear-cell sarcoma, all of which had characteristic karyotypes. Seven high-grade sarcomas had no specific karyotype or rearrangements for DDIT3, SS18, and EWSR1 by FISH.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is good correlation between karyotyping and FISH. Complex FISH signals found in dedifferentiated liposarcomas may be related to an increased chromosome 12 copy number and ploidy. Karyotyping is an important baseline standard for the quality assurance of newly developed FISH probes. It also provides a global view of chromosomal changes and the opportunity to investigate the role of other genetic alterations and potential therapeutic targets.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '6540630', '_score': 115.41629, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Pilot Projects [D010865:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]', 'Thymoma [D013945:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]', 'Thymus Neoplasms [D013953:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/mortality [Q000401:minor]', 'Time Factors [D013997:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Cisplatin [D002945:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]'], 'text': 'High-dose adriamycin (ADM) and cis-platinum (DDP) in advanced soft-tissue sarcomas and invasive thymomas.

Metabolized primarily by liver, T is also associated with transient transaminase elevation, with recommendations for hepatic function (HF) surveillance at baseline and during T therapy. Two studies have allowed further characterization of HF and T therapy: OVC1004 was a PK study of T in pts with advanced malignancies and hepatic dysfunction (HDF), and SAR3007 was a randomized phase 3 study of T vs. dacarbazine (D) in pts with advanced leio- and liposarcoma (Demetri, JCO 2015). Methods: OVC1004: Pts with advanced malignancies received single T dose: control group (normal HF) received T at 1.3mg/m2, and pts with HDF (baseline bilirubin: 1.5-3.0ULN, AST/ALT < 8ULN, stable for  8 days) received T at 0.58 or 0.9mg/m2. SAR3007: Pts with advanced leio- or liposarcoma post anthracycline and other standard therapy failure received T (1.5mg/m2 q3wk as 24h IV infusion) or D (1.0mg/m2q3wk as 1h IV infusion) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results: OVC1004 noted that plasma T exposure was higher in pts with HDF (n = 6) vs. control (n = 9) (geometric mean ratios [90% CI] for dose-normalized [DN] Cmax : 1.40 [0.99, 1.99]; DN AUClast : 1.97 [1.20; 3.22]), albeit with overlap of individual values. Hepatotoxicity analysis (SAR3007) confirmed that elevated transaminases were common (ALT 90%, G 3-4: 32%; AST 84%, G 3-4: 17%) and were the most frequent reasons for dose reductions, consistent with treatment guidelines. Transaminase elevations were transient and noncumulative even in pts with the highest (G 3-4) elevations. Importantly, PFS in pts with G 3-4 hepatotoxicity was similar to pts with G 0-2 hepatotoxicity (median PFS [95%CI]: 4.63 [4.01, 5.85] vs 3.55 [2.73, 4.63] p = 0.5453, HR = 0.91 [0.68-1.23]). Conclusions: Together, these studies affirm the current treatment guidelines of T, which prohibit dosing in pts with moderate or severe HDF and require dose reductions for G 3-4 transaminase elevations. Pts experiencing T-associated G 3-4 hepatotoxicity can receive clinical benefit with appropriate delay or modifications of T dosing.

RT was started in combination with second cycle and administered up to a total dose of 50.4 Gy. Surgery was scheduled 4-6 weeks after the end of RT. Primary end-point was 3-year relapse free survival (RFS). The trial is registered with ITASARC_∗II_2004_003.\n\nFINDINGS: Between December 2003 and 2010, 83 patients were recruited. Main histological subtypes were well differentiated liposarcoma (19/83, 23%), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (26/83, 31%), leiomyosarcoma (14/83, 17%). Median tumour size was 120 mm (interquartile (IQ) range=82-160). The overall preoperative treatment was completed in 60 patients. Chemotherapy (CT) was completed in 65, while RT in 73. Four patients progressed before surgery and were not operated. 79 patients underwent surgery. At a median follow-up of 4.8 years (IQ range = 3-6.1), 23 and 15 patients developed local recurrence (LR) and distant metastases (DM); 30 patients died of disease. 3 and 5-year RFS and overall survival were 0.56 (90% confidence interval (CI): 0.45, 0.65) and 0.44 (90% CI: 0.27, 0.48), and 0.74 (90% CI: 0.62, 0.81) and 0.59 (90% CI: 0.33, 0.58). Crude cumulative incidence of LR and DM at 5 years were 0.37 (standard error (SE): 0.06) and 0.26 (SE: 0.06).\n\nINTERPRETATION: The combination of preoperative HLI and RT was feasible in two thirds of patients, while preoperative RT could be completed in most (73/83). Although a systemic coverage can be added to RT when this is felt to be appropriate, the ongoing international phase III trial is exploring the role of RT alone.\n\nFUNDING: This is a pure academic trial.

Doxorubicin is a standard agent for sarcoma with proven efficacy. The combination of Gemcitabine, Docetaxel and Doxorubicin has been studied, and is well tolerated and active in breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. This study assesses the safety profile and efficacy of Gemcitabine, Doxorubicin, and Docetaxel regimen in patients with advanced, metastatic and/or unresectable sarcoma. Methods:  31 patients with advanced unresectable/metastatic sarcomas who progressed through standard chemotherapy were enrolled with consent. Patients were treated with Gemcitabine 400 mg/m2, Doxorubicin 20 mg/m2, and Docetaxel 20 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Disease was assessed with RECIST 1.1 and median Progression Free Survival(PFS) and Response rates(RR) were calculated. Toxicity evaluation was done using NCI CTCAE 4.2. Results:  All subjects had advanced metastatic disease and were treated with a median of 2 prior regimens(range1-6). The sarcoma subtypes were Leiomyosarcoma(29%), Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma(13%), Myxoid Liposarcoma(13%), Angiosarcoma(6%), Synovial Sarcoma(6%), Pleiomorphic Undifferentiated Sarcoma(6%) and other(27%). 31% patients were treated with prior Gemcitabine and Taxotere and 67% with prior Anthracycline. The median age was 53(range25-72). 31 patients were enrolled and 26 were evaluable for response. A partial response was observed in one patient and stable disease in 24 patients with a median PFS of 3.5 months. Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias were observed in 45% of patients(7neutropenia, 3Anemia, and 5thrombocytopenia). One patient was taken off study due to toxicity and no significant grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicities were seen. Conclusions:  The combination of Gemcitabine, Doxorubicin and Docetaxel is well tolerated with manageable toxicity profile. Though response rates were low, this heavily pretreated population demonstrated durable stable disease even when rechallenged with prior used agents.

Methods: Patients (pts) with advanced malignancies and adequate hepatic and renal function were eligible for enrollment in this phase I trial. Pts with significant pre-existing fluid retention were excluded. CS-7017 was administered orally twice daily (BID) in a dose escalating fashion starting at 0.1 mg, and restaging occurred every 6 weeks. Pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected at day 1 and 22. Archived tumor specimens were assayed for relevant biomarkers by immunohistochemistry. Results: 32 pts were enrolled, 31 received CS-7017 (22 male; age range 40-72 years) at doses ranging from 0.10-1.15 mg BID. The most common cancers were colorectal (n=12), liposarcoma (n=5), and leiomyosarcoma (n=2). 27 pts were evaluable for response.

CS-7017 was well tolerated. Most patients experienced peripheral edema (17/31), often requiring diuretics. 3 dose-limiting toxicities, all related to fluid retention, were observed, but without clear relation to dose. The protocol-defined maximum tolerated dose was not reached, but 0.50 mg BID was selected as the recommended phase II dose based on PK/PD and safety analyses. CS-7017 increased plasma adiponectin levels by 6-14-fold at 4 weeks. The plasma concentrations of CS-7017 appeared dose proportional. Analysis of pretreatment tumor specimens demonstrated that PPARg and RXR protein expression was significantly higher in patients with prolonged SD or PR (1-sided O'Brien's nonparametic global test: p=0.0079), suggesting a possible predictive biomarker for response. Conclusions: CS-7017 demonstrates promising evidence of antitumor activity and disease stabilization with acceptable tolerability.

However, the specific role of TLS has not been clarified. TLS-null neurons display abnormal spine morphology, suggesting that TLS-deficiency may impair activity-dependent actin reorganization in spines. To address this issue, we screened for mouse brain transcripts by their in vitro binding to TLS, and identified RNAs that associate with TLS, including mRNAs encoding actin-related proteins such as actin-stabilizing protein Nd1-L. Nd1-L transcripts were increased in the dendrites upon mGluR activation and significantly reduced in TLS-null dendrites. Overexpression of Nd1-L in mouse hippocampal neurons prevented damage to spine structure caused by actin destabilization.

We demonstrate that FUS is rapidly recruited to sites of laser-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a manner that requires poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase activity, but is independent of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase function. FUS recruitment is mediated by the arginine/glycine-rich domains, which interact directly with PAR. In addition, we identify a role for the prion-like domain in promoting accumulation of FUS at sites of DNA damage. Finally, depletion of FUS diminished DSB repair through both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining, implicating FUS as an upstream participant in both pathways. These results identify FUS as a new factor in the immediate response to DSBs that functions downstream of PAR polymerase to preserve genomic integrity.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_180325-199', '_score': 108.41933, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstracts\nTitle: Retroperitoneal lipo-leiomyomata in a woman with history of breast cancer and antiestrogen therapy.\n\n\nBackground: Retroperitoneal lipo-leiomyomata are extremely rare. The usual-type retroperitoneal leiomyoma is itself a rare tumor that is mistaken preoperatively for malignant retroperitoneal tumors or thought of as an exophytic subserosal leiomyoma of the uterus. Lipo-leiomyoma is a variant of leiomyoma with an incidence in uterus ranging between 0.03% - 0.2%, but its presentation as a retroperitoneal mass has not been documented in literature yet. We present a unique case of retroperitoneal lipo-leiomyoma that presented as a diagnostic challenge due to its unique location and unusual histologic appearance. Methods: A 68-year-old female patient with a history of breast cancer diagnosed 4 years ago, currently on antiestrogen therapy (Fulvestrant) and Herceptin, presented to our university hospital with symptomatic left pelvic mass. An abdominal CT showed a heterogeneous low-density pelvic mass with foci of internal calcification and fat with surrounding intermixed intermediate and high density fluid in the expected location of the uterus. Results: A debulking surgery including radical hysterectomy was planned. Intraoperatively, a normal sized uterus was found, the myometrium of which contained multiple variable-sized intramural leiomyomata. In addition, a huge left retroperitoneal mass was found that had no connection to the uterus. Histopathological examination revealed abenign lipoleiomyomatous tumor, composed of an encapsulated proliferation of benign adipocytes and myoid cells intimately admixed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed myoid differentiation, with negative reactions for HMB45 and CKIT, and . MDM2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was negative. Conclusions: Some unusually located extra-uterine leiomyomata have been reported; retroperitoneal leiomyoma being among them. Such a tumor with the added feature of lipomatous differentiation presents a differential diagnosis that includes leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiomyolipoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The association of an uncommonly located leiomyoma with subsequent lipomatous change withantiestrogen therapy is an unexplored issue that merits further investigation.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'AACR_2016-344', '_score': 107.47183, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': "Meeting: 2016 AACR Annual Meeting\nTitle: Antimitotic effect and complex of nonmitotic effect on tumor biology of eribulin mesilate in soft tissue sarcoma model\n\n\nBackground and objectives: Eribulin mesilate (Eribulin), a first-in-class halichondrin B-based microtubule dynamics inhibitor, has been shown to have novel mechanism of actions (reversion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cell and promotion of vascular remodeling) beyond its established antimitotic activity in breast cancer models, leading to decrease of tumor metastatic potency. Recently, eribulin showed trends towards greater overall survival compared to Dacarbazine in subjects with leiomyosarcoma and liposarcoma patients in phase 3 trial. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of eribulin on tumor cell proliferation of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Furthermore, the effects of eribulin on morphology and gene expression of differentiation markers against STS and tumor blood perfusion in a leiomyosarcoma xenograft model were examined.Methods: Anti-proliferation activity of eribulin was examined in 6 human STS cell lines. Anti-tumor activity of eribulin was examined in xenografts of A-673 (Ewing's sarcoma), SK-LMS-1 (leiomyosarcoma), SW 872 (liposarcoma), and HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma) at several doses. To analyze the effect of eribulin on in vitro morphological change, 3 human STS cell lines were treated with eribulin at 1, 3, and 10 nmol/L for 7 days. Gene expression change was analyzed by microarray and differentiation marker genes in 2 cell lines were confirmed by qPCR analysis. For tumor blood perfusion analysis, eribulin was administered at doses of 0.38, 0.75, and 1.5 mg/kg one shot in SK-LMS-1 xenografts, and tumor blood perfusion was calculated as Hoechst-positive areas in tumor cryosections 5 days after the administration.Results: Eribulin showed anti-proliferation activity in vitro against all 6 cell lines in a dose dependent manner with 50% inhibitory concentration values of around 1 nmol/L. Eribulin showed significant antitumor activity against 4 xenografts in a dose dependent manner. Eribulin treatment for 7 days induced apparent morphological change in 3 cell lines. Of these, expression level of smooth muscle differentiation marker gene CNN1 was 7.1-fold upregulated in SK-UT-1 and adipocyte differentiation marker genes MYLK, C/EBP, and KIF23 were 1.9-, 1.4-, and 1.3-fold upregulated in SW 872, respectively, by 10 nmol/L treatment compared to vehicle control. In addition, eribulin significantly enhanced tumor blood perfusion compared to vehicle control 5 days after the administration in SK-LMS-1 xenografts at all doses.Conclusions: Eribulin showed anti-proliferation activity against all of STS cell lines we tested in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, eribulin might cause differentiation of STS cells and remodeling of tumor vasculature to enhance tumor blood perfusion. These data supported that eribulin showed mitotic effect and non-mitotic effect, which may decrease tumor metastatic potency in STS, as well in breast cancer.\n"}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '23533276', '_score': 107.035324, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Alleles [D000483:minor]', 'Mice, Transgenic [D008822:minor]', 'Mutagenesis [D016296:minor]', 'Neoplasm Transplantation [D009368:minor]', 'Oncogene Proteins [D015513:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic [D011401:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1 [D050784:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets [D050783:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Recombination, Genetic [D011995:minor]', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA [D017422:minor]', 'Signal Transduction [D015398:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Transcription Factors [D014157:minor]', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG [D000071230:minor]', 'DNA Transposable Elements [D004251:minor]', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic [D015973:major]', 'Genotype [D005838:minor]', 'Janus Kinase 2 [D053614:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute [D004915:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute [D007947:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]'], 'text': 'Transposon mutagenesis reveals cooperation of ETS family transcription factors with signaling pathways in erythro-megakaryocytic leukemia.\n\n\nTo define genetic lesions driving leukemia, we targeted cre-dependent Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis to the blood-forming system using a hematopoietic-selective vav 1 oncogene (vav1) promoter. Leukemias of diverse lineages ensued, most commonly lymphoid leukemia and erythroleukemia. The inclusion of a transgenic allele of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)V617F resulted in acceleration of transposon-driven disease and strong selection for erythroleukemic pathology with transformation of bipotential erythro-megakaryocytic cells. The genes encoding the E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors Ets related gene (Erg) and Ets1 were the most common sites for transposon insertion in SB-induced JAK2V617F-positive erythroleukemias, present in 87.5% and 65%, respectively, of independent leukemias examined. The role of activated Erg was validated by reproducing erythroleukemic pathology in mice transplanted with fetal liver cells expressing translocated in liposarcoma (TLS)-ERG, an activated form of ERG found in human leukemia. Via application of SB mutagenesis to TLS-ERG-induced erythroid transformation, we identified multiple loci as likely collaborators with activation of Erg. Jak2 was identified as a common transposon insertion site in TLS-ERG-induced disease, strongly validating the cooperation between JAK2V617F and transposon insertion at the Erg locus in the JAK2V617F-positive leukemias. Moreover, loci expressing other regulators of signal transduction pathways were conspicuous among the common transposon insertion sites in TLS-ERG-driven leukemia, suggesting that a key mechanism in erythroleukemia may be the collaboration of lesions disturbing erythroid maturation, most notably in genes of the ETS family, with mutations that reduce dependence on exogenous signals.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25816393', '_score': 106.29606, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'Vulvar sarcomas: Short guideline for histopathological recognition and clinical management.

Sarcomas represent a rational target for this approach given the high frequency of p53 mutations (40-75%) and MDM-2 amplification (10-30%). We, therefore, undertook a phase I/II study of ONYX-015, days 1-5 every month administered intratumorally under radiographic guidance, in combination with MAP (mitomycin-C, doxorubicin, cisplatin) chemotherapy in patients with advanced sarcoma. Six patients were treated. Injected lesions included liver metastases in four patients and chest wall metastases in two patients. Sarcoma histologies were gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST, two patients), leiomyosarcoma (two patients), liposarcoma (one patient), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1 patient). Dose escalation was performed from 10(9) plaque forming units (PFU)/dose (total dose of 5 x 10(9) PFU/cycle) to 10(10) PFU/dose (total dose of 5 x 10(10) PFU/cycle) without dose-limiting toxicity being encountered. Immunohistochemistry of the metastatic lesions prior to treatment showed that five out of six patients were positive for p53, while two patients also had mdm-2 overexpression. Adenoviral replication was detected in two out of six patient biopsies on day 5 of the first cycle, by in situ hybridization (ISH). Both patients were treated at the highest dose level. ONYX-015 viral DNA was detected by quantitative PCR in the plasma of 5/6 patients on day 5 of the first cycle, and up to day 12 (7 days after the last viral dose) in one patient who had extended sampling for viral kinetics performed, suggesting viral replication in sarcoma tissue. One patient with p53 mutation and MDM-2 amplification achieved a partial response to treatment that lasted 11 months. In conclusion, intratumoral administration of ONYX-015 in combination with MAP chemotherapy is well tolerated with no significant toxicity due to ONYX-015 being encountered. Detection of viral DNA in post treatment tumor specimens by ISH and detection of the ONYX-015 genome in the peripheral blood by quantitative PCR, up to 7 days after the last viral dose provide evidence for adenoviral replication. There was evidence of antitumor activity in one out of six patients.

However, two thirds of diagnosed tumors are unresectable and/or metastatic, with a median survival of 12 months, and chemotherapy is the only treatment option. Temozolomide has been used in soft tissue sarcomas and has shown the most activity in leiomyosarcomas; response rates ranged from 5-15%. Azacitidine has not previously been used in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. Because of known effects of hypomethylating agents on caspase-8 genes, and the DNA repair gene MGMT involved in the action of temozolomide, we hypothesized that incorporating azacitidine into the treatment of soft tissue tumors with temozolomide could enhance its efficacy.  Methods:  Between June 2008 and July 2012, 28 patients with soft tissue sarcomas were enrolled. Among the 25 patients who completed the treatment, median age was 61 (range 41-83), 13 male and 12 female; 4 liposarcoma, 2 myxoid liposarcoma, 1 synovial sarcoma, 1 granular cell sarcoma, 1 epithelioid mesothelioma, 1 Ewings sarcoma, 1 hemangioepithelioma, 7 leiomyosarcoma, 1 spindle cell sarcoma and 6 unspecified sarcoma. Treatment consisted of 10-11 cycles of azacitidine and temozolomide. Dosing: Azacitidine: dose level 1: 25mg/m2 SQ qd; dose level 2: 50mg/m2 SQ qd; dose level 3: 75 mg/m2 SQ qd; combined with temozolomide: 200 mg/m2PO qd x 5; both on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle. Toxicity was graded by CTCAE IV.  Results:  Median number of cycles administered: 2 (range 1-6). There were nine drug-related adverse events experienced by 3 or more patients, none of which were dose-limiting. The maximum tolerated dose was 200mg/m2 temozolomide and 75 mg/m2 azacitidine. 15 patients died from their disease 2-59 months after enrollment; 10 patients are alive with stable disease.  The median overall survival was 22 (95% CI:9-59) months, with a 1-year survival of 64% (95% CI:42-79%).  Conclusions:  We have not yet determined the antitumor effectiveness of this combination.

In prospective series, long-lasting T treatment showed responses in 44% of patients (pts) with ML. ML is also sensitive to radiation therapy (RT) and preclinical data suggested radiosensitizing properties of T. Preoperative short-course of T with concurrent low-dose RT was conducted in a multicenter, European, phase I/II trial. We present here data from the phase I part in pts with centralized diagnosis of locally advanced, resectable ML. Methods: Pts received 3 cycles (C) of T in combination with RT (45 Gy) in 25 fractions (1.8Gy/fraction). The phase I had the classic 3+3 design. Dose Levels for T were: -1 (1.1 mg/m2), 1 (1.3 mg/m2) and 2 (1.5 mg/m2). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) were defined as grade 3 events excluding G3/4 neutropenia lasting < 5 days and G3-4 nausea/vomiting due to inadequate prophylaxis. RECIST responses were evaluated preoperatively at week 10. Surgical specimens were processed for histologic changes and residual tumor. Results: From February 2015 to May 2016,14 pts (M/F 7/7) with median age 36y (24-71) and median tumor size 12.5 cm were enrolled. 7 pts received T at dose Level 1 and 7 pts at Level 2. One DLT (G3 transaminitis) occurred at Level 1 and another (sepsis due to catheter infection) at Level 2. Overall, grade G 3/4 AEs were: ALT elevation (n = 6, 43%), and GGT elevation, neutropenia, anemia, epithelitis and sepsis (n = 1, 7% each). There were no deaths. One pt developed metastasis after C3 and did not undergo surgery; another one had a sepsis after C1 and received definitive RT. All pts completed RT. 13 pts were evaluable for response: 5 achieved PR (38%), 7 SD (53%), 1 distant PD (8%). 12 pts underwent surgery (7 R0/5 R1).

It has been demonstrated that a Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) gene can convert certain nucleoside analogs, such as ganciclovir, which disrupt DNA synthesis and are toxic to nucleosides. Human chondrosarcoma cells transduced with the HSV-tk gene were more sensitive to the cytotoxity of ganciclovir than non-transduced cells.

Eighty seven neoplasms of the spleen considered to be of nonangiomatous and nonlymphomatous origin were selected for morphologic classification, mitotic index determination, immunohistochemical analysis, and patient survival determination. In 76/87 cases, patient survival information was available, and the mitotic index was determined in 83/87 cases. Immunohistochemistry for selected antigens (vimentin, desmin, smooth muscle actin, myosin, and factor VIII-related antigen) was performed in 58/87 of the cases. Morphologic classification of these lesions in standard HE preparations yielded the following neoplastic groups: fibrosarcoma (19/87), undifferentiated sarcoma (19/87), leiomyosarcoma (14/87), osteosarcoma (8/87), mesenchymoma (7/87), myxosarcoma (6/87), histiocytic sarcoma (6/87), leiomyoma (3/87), lipoma-myelolipoma (2/87), liposarcoma (2/87), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1/87). A lack of distinct morphologic characteristics among many of the neoplasms that were classified as either fibrosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, or undifferentiated sarcoma contrasted these groups with the relatively unambiguous features that distinguished the other sarcoma groups. Using immunohistochemical staining for muscle-specific antigens (desmin, smooth muscle actin, and myosin), specific staining often overlapped extensively within the neoplastic groups of fibrosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and undifferentiated sarcomas, suggesting either ambiguous morphologic findings or the possibility of a common histogenesis from smooth muscle trabeculae or a distinct population of splenic myofibroblasts. The biological behavior of all tumors examined could be placed into three categories of patient survival: (1) benign, noninvasive tumors (leiomyoma, lipoma) with prolonged survival intervals; (2) malignant tumors (fibrosarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, myxosarcoma, histiocytic sarcoma, and liposarcoma), showing severely truncated survival (median 4 months with 80-100% mortality after 12 months; and (3) intermediate survival periods (median 12 months with 50% 1 year survival) attributed to a single group of neoplasm, the mesenchymomas.

Pts treated with q3wk 24-h had a 16% reduction in the relative risk of death (HR=0.843; p=0.1931). Median (95%CI) OS were 13.9 mo (12.5-18.6; q3wk 24-h) and 11.8 mo (9.9-14.9; qwk 3-h) (log-rank p=0.1920). OS rates at 12 mo were 60% (q3wk 24-h) and 50% (qwk 3-h). Sensitivity analyses censoring at crossover further highlighted this favorable trend in survival with trabectedin q3wk 24-h.

One pt had reversible, grade 3 sensory and autonomic neuropathy and two pts had grade 4 thrombocytopenia (6%). Of the 33 evaluable patients, stable disease was seen in 21/33 (64%) of pts along with decrease of tumor burden (ranging from 5  23%) in 7 patients. There were 12 pts (36%) that progressed. In pts with progressive LPS and LMS, the median progression free survival (mPFS) on selinexor was 4.2 months (mo) and 3.7 mo, respectively. PK was similar to previously published results and there was better absorption in the fed state compared to fasting and fat content did not affect bioavailability. Matched pre- and post-tumor biopsies (N = 6) showed target inhibition of XPO1 by nuclear localization of p53, apoptosis by increased cleaved caspase, marked reduction in cellularity and Ki-67 and increase in stroma.  Conclusions: Oral selinexor administered twice weekly was well tolerated with manageable toxicities. Selinexor demonstrated durable stable disease in various soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

Interestingly, we observed that FUS/TLS genetically interacts with TDP-43 in a mutation-dependent fashion to cause neurodegeneration in vivo.

MLN8237 (alisertib) is a novel oral adenosine triphosphate-competitive AURKA inhibitor.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored phase II study of alisertib was conducted through the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (A091102). Patients were enrolled into histology-defined cohorts: (i) liposarcoma, (ii) leiomyosarcoma, (iii) undifferentiated sarcoma, (iv) malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, or (v) other. Treatment was alisertib 50 mg PO b.i.d. d1-d7 every 21 days. The primary end point was response rate; progression-free survival (PFS) was secondary. One response in the first 9 patients expanded enrollment in a cohort to 24 using a Simon two-stage design.\n\nRESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled at 24 sites [12 LPS, 10 LMS, 11 US, 10 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), 29 Other]. The median age was 55 years; 54% were male; 58%/38%/4% were ECOG PS 0/1/2. One PR expanded enrollment to the second stage in the other sarcoma cohort.

There are more than a hundred different types of sarcomas from the histological point of view. This is the main limitation at the time of finding major clinic essays on patients with specific types of sarcomas. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are grouped into two main types: (a) sarcomas showing specific genetic alterations and relatively simple karyotypes, and translocations which originate gene fusions (e.g., EWS-FLI1 in Ewing tumour); or specific genetic mutations (e.g., c-kit in the gastrointestinal stromal tumour), and (b) sarcomas showing unspecific gene alterations and very complex karyotypes, and very numerous gains and losses.

Many soft tissue neoplasms show specific karyotypic aberrations which have proved to be diagnostically valuable, and have also assisted in the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and rationalisation of classification systems (e.g. lipomatous tumours and Ewing\'s sarcoma/PNET). In certain clinical subsets, especially round cell sarcomas and fatty neoplasms, determination of karyotype (whether by conventional analysis, FISH or RT-PCR) has proved often to be useful in the diagnostic setting. Additionally the recognition of clonal abnormalities in both benign neoplasms as well as lesions formerly thought to be non-neoplastic (e.g. inflammatory "pseudotumour") has prompted reassessment of biologic concepts with regard to growth control. Inherited molecular genetic defects which predispose to soft tissue neoplasia (e.g. NF-1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome) have been characterised, leading to a greater understanding of tumour suppressor genes. Mesenchymal differentiation genes, the modes of action of which may help to expunge concepts of histogenesis, are being characterised. It is becoming clear that there exist growth control genes (such as the HMGI family) which, irrespective of differentiation, play an important role in a wide range of different mesenchymal tumours. Additionally it is evident that different histologic types of sarcoma (e.g. variants of liposarcoma) show quite different abnormalities of cell cycle control (notably at the G1-S checkpoint) and it seems increasingly likely that certain genetic aberrations, identifiable either at the chromosomal or individual gene level, may prove to be of prognostic relevance in sarcomas and may also open novel therapeutic avenues.

Studies on ncRNAs have been radically progressed mainly regarding microRNAs, piRNAs, siRNAs, and related small ncRNAs of which length are relatively short nucleotides (Fire et al., Nature 391:806-811, 1998; Filipowicz et al., Nat Rev Genet 9:102-114, 2008; Lau et al., Science 313:363-367, 2006; Brennecke et al., Science 322:1387-1392, 2008; Siomi and Siomi, Nature 457:396-404, 2009). These small RNAs play roles in regulation of translation and gene silencing while long ncRNAs with length more than 200 nucleotides have been emerging and turn out to be involved in regulation of transcription (Kapranov et al., Science 316:1484-1488, 2007; Ponting et al., Cell 136:629-641, 2009; Kurokawa et al., RNA Biol 6:233-236, 2009). Recently, we have identified novel, long ncRNAs bearing capability of repression of transcription (Wang et al., Nature 454:126-130, 2008).RNA-binding protein, translocated in liposarcoma (TLS), binds CREB-binding protein CBP/adenovirus p300 and inhibits their histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activities (Wang et al., Nature 454:126-130, 2008). The HAT inhibitory activity of TLS requires specific binding of RNA. The systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment experiments with randomized sequences revealed that TLS specifically recognizes RNA oligonucleotides containing GGUG as a consensus sequence although the GGUG sequence is not an absolute requirement for the TLS binding (Lerga et al., J Biol Chem 276:6807-6816, 2001). TLS is specifically recruited to the CBP/p300-associated binding sites of the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) and the cyclin E1 gene (CCNE1) promoters (Wang et al., Nature 454:126-130, 2008; Impey et al., Cell 119:1041-1054, 2004). Our extensive exploration for naturally occurring RNA molecule that binds TLS has indicated that long ncRNAs (promoter-associated ncRNAs: pncRNAs) transcribed from the CCND1 promoter bind TLS and inhibit the HAT activities on the sites to repress the transcription of the CCND1 gene (Wang et al., Nature 454:126-130, 2008). We have optimized RT-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, RNA immunoprecipitation, and RNA gel-shift assay in order to detect these pncRNAs. The methods that we have developed successfully identified these low-abundant, long ncRNAs and provide the data showing that the CCND1 pncRNAs bind TLS and induce its HAT inhibitory activity to repress the transcription of CCND1 gene upon genotoxic stress.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_32330-65', '_score': 99.00111, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: Trabectedin for advanced sarcomas failing doxorubicin: Analysis of 189 unreported patients in a compassionate use program.\n\n\nBackground: Between 2005 and 2008, 387 patients (pts) with advanced sarcoma failing doxorubicin were treated in a compassionate use program (ATU) of trabectedin in France using the standard 1.5mg/m2/CI 24h q21d regimen. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of pts treated in this program. Methods: From 2005 to 2008, 87 centers (ctrs) included at least 1 pt in the ATU program. Inclusion criteria were those of the EORTC trial (J Clin Oncol, 2005;23:5276), with no restriction on the previous number of lines. A simple CRF with 22 items was used to collect pts characteristics and outcome. One hundred eighty-nine pts files were collected as of December 20, 2008. Univariate and multivariate analyses of prognostic factors was performed. Results: Two hundred thirty-five pts were included in the 17 ctrs in which >4 pts were treated. Forty-four ctrs treated only 1 pt. Fifty-two percent were female; major histological subgroups were leiomyosarcoma (29%) and liposarcoma (20%). All pts had been treated with doxorubicin and ifosfamide, 3 (1.5%) in adjuvant setting only. Trabectedin was given in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th line in metastatic phase in n=8, 69, 66, 42 pts respectively (median: 3rd line). The median number of courses were 3 (range 1-24). Best response reported were PR, n=15 (8%), SD, n=68 (36%) and PD, n=94 (50%), NE, n=11 (6%). With a median follow-up of 805 days (d), median PFS and OS were 91 d and 309 d respectively. 27/127 (20%) evaluable pts had to be hospitalized for treatment related side effects. PFS was superior in myxoid liposarcoma (MyxLPS) (median 192 d vs 69 d, p=0.003), retroperitoneal sarcomas (median 104 d vs 69 d, p=0.006), and grade 1 tumors (median 141 d vs 70 d, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis (Cox model), tumor site, grade 1, histotype were the only independent prognostic factors for PFS. For OS, favorable prognostic factors in univariate analysis were histotypes (MyxLPS, MFH), grade 1 lesions, retroperitoneal site , no hospitalisation for toxicity (p<0.01 all) while Cox model identified female gender, tumor site, histotype as the only independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusions: In this compassionate use program for heavily pretreated pts with advanced sarcomas, trabectedin yielded PFS and OS close to those observed in phase II and III trial. PFS and OS are superior in myxLPS, retroperitoneal sarcomas, and grade 1 tumors. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'AACR_2014-4526', '_score': 98.84818, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': "Meeting: 2014 AACR Annual Meeting\nTitle: BIBF1120, an investigational triple angiokinase inhibitor, in combination with inhibitors of mTOR signaling shows potent antitumor activity in preclinical models of sarcoma\n\n\nBIBF1120 (Nintedanib), an investigational potent small molecule angiokinase inhibitor, selectively binds to and blocks receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Nintedanib has shown promising results in preclinical as well as clinical studies of non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal, ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. We tested the in vitro anti-proliferative activity of BIBF1120 in a panel of sarcoma cell lines including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), synovial (SYO-I), Ewing's (CHP100), osteo (SaOS2) and liposarcoma (LS141). Our results indicate that when compared to other potent RTK inhibitors such as Imatinib and Pazopanib, BIBF1120 is highly efficient at nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations in blocking proliferative activity of sarcoma cell lines, specifically, SYO-I and MPNST, which are highly dependent on PDGFR signaling. Western blot analysis to test the efficacy of BIBF1120 confirmed significant blockade of RTK signaling pathways. Ras activation and/or activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway has been shown to be critical in sarcomas including MPNST and synovial sarcomas. Unlike Imatinib and Pazopanib, BIBF1120 also blocked MAPK signaling pathway as demonstrated by p-ERK1/2 blockade. In addition to the RTKs, mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) protein plays a key role in AKT activation and downstream survival signaling. Combination of RTK blockade by BIBF1120 and mTOR blockade by TORC1 inhibitor rapamycin resulted in significantly stronger inhibition of in vitro cellular proliferation compared to single agent treatments. Taken together, our data strongly supports further clinical research of BIBF1120 in sarcoma. Combining potent inhibitors of tyrosine kinase signaling, MAPK signaling and inhibitors of mTOR pathway such as rapamycin could provide a new therapeutic approach in this disease.\n"}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19119867', '_score': 98.47825, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Molecular Structure [D015394:minor]', 'Plasmodium falciparum [D010963:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Ruthenium Compounds [D017975:minor]/chemical synthesis [Q000138:major]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared [D013055:minor]', 'Antimalarials [D000962:minor]/chemical synthesis [Q000138:major]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/chemical synthesis [Q000138:major]/chemistry [Q000737:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Cell Proliferation [D049109:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]', 'Chloroquine [D002738:minor]/chemistry [Q000737:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy [D009682:minor]', 'Models, Molecular [D008958:minor]'], 'text': 'Synthesis, characterization, and in vitro antimalarial and antitumor activity of new ruthenium(II) complexes of chloroquine.\n\n\nThe new Ru(II) chloroquine complexes [Ru(eta(6)-arene)(CQ)Cl2] (CQ = chloroquine; arene = p-cymene 1, benzene 2), [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)(CQ)(H2O)2][BF4]2 (3), [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)(CQ)(en)][PF6]2 (en = ethylenediamine) (4), and [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)(eta(6)-CQDP)][BF4]2 (5, CQDP = chloroquine diphosphate) have been synthesized and characterized by use of a combination of NMR and FTIR spectroscopy with DFT calculations.

Recently, it has been reported that parvoviruses confer various antineoplastic properties to infected cells, and that adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2) infection sensitizes malignant epithelial cells to radiation- or chemotherapy-based genotoxic treatment. Thus, we analyzed whether AAV-2 infection leads to an improved efficacy of doxorubicin chemotherapy in malignant mesenchymal cells, using 13 human sarcoma cell lines. Therapeutic effects were analyzed by measuring cell viability and proliferation (WST-1, colony forming, and propidium iodide assays). Additionally, permissivity for AAV-2 infection was determined by Southern dot blot analysis. AAV-2 infection strongly increased the efficacy of doxorubicin treatment in rhabdomyo-, fibro-, osteo- and chondrosarcoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was not observed in liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma cells, although a susceptability to AAV-2 infection was documented.

AR is essential for the growth and survival of prostate cancer cells and is therefore a target for current and next-generation therapeutic modalities against prostate cancer. Pathophysiologically relevant protein-protein interaction networks involving AR are, however, poorly understood.

The hormonal response of FUS expression in LNCaP cells was shown to resemble that of other AR co-activators. FUS displayed a strong intrinsic transactivation capacity in prostate cancer cells when tethered to basal promoters using the GAL4 system. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that FUS was recruited to ARE III of the enhancer region of the PSA gene.

Manipulation of immune checkpoints such as CTLA4 or PD-1 with targeted antibodies, has recently emerged as an effective anticancer strategy in multiple malignancies. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of patients (pts) with relapsed metastatic sarcomas, who were treated with nivolumab provided under a patient assistance program from the manufacturer. Pts underwent CT or PET/CT imaging at baseline and after at least 6 doses of nivolumab; RECIST criteria were used for response assessment. Results: Twenty-three pretreated pts with metastatic soft tissue (STS, N = 20) or bone sarcoma (N = 3), received IV nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks from July 2015 to January 2016. Median age was 58 (24-78), male:female was 10:13; ECOG PS was 0-1 in 19 pts, 2 in 4 pts; the median number of previous treatments was two (0-5); the median number of nivolumab cycles was six; thirteen pts concomitantly received the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib at 800mg daily. The most common side effect was grade 1 or 2 LFT elevations (9 pts, 5 of them receiving pazopanib); grade 3-4 toxicity occurred in 4 pts: grade 4 pneumonitis in 1, grade 3 colitis in 1 and grade 4 LFT elevations in 2 pts. Fourteen pts receiving at least 6 cycles thus far were evaluable for response.

Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases are caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS) gene have been recently discovered to be associated with familial ALS. We found FUS/TLS mutations in familial ALS cases in Japan. Even in Asian races, ALS with FUS/TLS mutations may have common characteristics of early onset, rapid progress, high penerence trait. We developed rats that express a human SOD1 transgene with two different ALS-associated mutations (G93A and H46R) develop striking motor neuron degeneration and paralysis. The larger size of this rat model as compared with the ALS mice will facilitate studies involving manipulations of spinal fluid (implantation of intrathecal catheters for chronic therapeutic studies; CSF sampling) and spinal cord (e.g., direct administration of viral- and cell-mediated therapies). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent survival-promoting factors for motor neurons. To examine its both protective effect on motor neurons and therapeutic potential, we administered human recombinant HGF (hrHGF) by continuous intrathecal delivery to G93A transgenic rats at onset of paralysis for 4 weeks. Intrathecal administration of hrHGF attenuates motor neuron degeneration and prolonged the duration of the disease by 63%. Our results indicated the therapeutic efficacy of continuous intrathecal administration of hrHGF in ALS rats. In addition, HGF is capable of reducing astrocytosis and microglial accumulation, and thus supports the attention of a glial-dependent mechanism of ALS progression.

Intra-abdominal aggressive fibromatosis may express actin and CD117 but catenin is also positive, leiomyosarcoma expresses the actin and/or desmin but CD117 is usually negative, retroperitoneal dedifferentiated liposarcoma is CD117 negative and PS100 positive, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is negative for CD117 and CD34. The solitary fibrous tumor expresses CD34 and is negative to CD117. Some tumors expressing CD117 such desmoplastic round cell tumor should not be confused with EGIST.

Univariate log-rank analysis was used to evaluate potential prognostic factors.\n\nRESULTS: Presentation was new primary disease, 74; primary recurrence, 20; metastases, 10. Pathology was liposarcoma for 42, leiomyosarcoma for 22, malignant fibrous histiocytoma for 19, and 21 with other histologies. Grade was low for 36, high for 35, and 33 were not graded. Median tumor size was 17 cm. Grossly complete surgical excision was achieved for 45 (43%), of whom 6 (6%) also had clear surgical margins. Adjuvant postoperative irradiation was administered to 36 patients to a median dose of 40 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks and 16 received adjuvant chemotherapy. Nine patients received no adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. Gross residual tumor was present postoperatively in 57 patients. The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 36% and 14%, respectively. The locoregional relapse free rate (RFR) was 28% at 5 years and 9% at 10 years, and the distant RFR was 76% at 5 years and 60% at 10 years. For the 45 patients treated with complete excision, survival was 55% and 22% at 5 and 10 years, and locoregional RFR was 50% and 18% at 5 and 10 years. Univariate analysis demonstrated that complete surgical removal was the only factor significant for improved survival, locoregional RFR, and distant RFR. Liposarcoma histology predicted for improved survival (p = 0.02), and leiomyosarcoma histology for a lower distant RFR, compared to other histologies (p = 0.003). Patients under 62 years had an improved survival (p = 0.002) and local RFR (p = 0.02), and patients presenting with recurrent disease had improved survival (p = 0.03). Sex, tumor size, or grade, or the use of adjuvant chemotherapy were not predictive for any of the endpoints tested. Those who received adjuvant irradiation following gross surgical clearance experienced a prolonged median locoregional RFR over those who did not, and this approached statistical significance for those receiving radiation doses > 35 Gy. (103 months vs. 30 months, p = 0.06). Statistical significance was reached (p = 0.02) if only the infield RFR was considered.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that failure to achieve local control is the primary cause of treatment failure for patients with RSTS, and that postoperative irradiation in doses > 35 Gy after complete surgery delayed, but did not prevent local recurrence. Improvements in outcome for patients with RSTS will require alternate treatment strategies, and preoperative irradiation with an aggressive surgical attempt at complete excision is currently under investigation.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'AACR_2014-1723', '_score': 94.98327, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2014 AACR Annual Meeting\nTitle: Effect and mechanism of PF299804 alone and in combination with STAT3 inhibitor in human sarcoma cell lines\n\n\nBackground: Curative treatment of sarcomas is achieved by surgical resection, supplemented with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative radiation. Approximately 50% of patients will eventually die. We previously reported that 78% (36/46) of our cohort of patients with soft tissue sarcoma were positive for total EGFR/HER1. The EGFR/HER1 pathway is an important molecular target; its inhibition is now well established clinically in several epithelial-origin tumors. No pan-HER inhibitors have yet been tested in sarcomas. The principal aim of this project was to investigate the effect and mechanism of PF299804 (an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor) therapy alone and in combination with STAT3 inhibitor in human sarcoma cell lines.Methods: PF299804 mono-therapy and in combination with STAT3 inhibitor (S3I-201) were investigated in a panel of 12 human sarcoma cell lines. Crystal-violet colorimetric and clonogenic assays were used to measure drug effects. Soft agar colony formation assay was used to evaluate anchorage-independent growth (the ability to evade anoikis). For assessing potential mechanisms, we investigated expression and activity of EGFR signalling by Western blot.Results: HER family receptors (EGFR/HER1, HER2 and HER3) were positively expressed in the sarcoma cell lines representing liposarcoma (778 and 449b), fibrosarcoma (SW684 and HT1080), synovial sarcoma (SW980), fibrous histocytoma (GCT) and osteosarcoma (143B, HOS, MG63, SJSA, U2-OS and Saos-2). IC50 values of PF299804 were more than 1M in these cell lines, which was about 1000-fold higher than the sensitive control lung cell line PC9. Mechanism studies by Western blot assay found that 200nM PF299804 (emulating total plasma exposure measured in human clinical trial) dramatically suppressed the activation of both EGFR/HER1 and HER2, as well as their representative downstream signalling factors Erk1/2, p38MAPK and SAPK/JNK in ras/raf/MAPK and AKT in PI3K/AKT pathways, but not of STAT3. Combination therapy using PF299804 and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 achieved synergistic anti-proliferation in 3 out of 4 sarcoma cell lines (449B, 778, 143B and HOS), representing different subtype, grade, recurrence and metastasis: 449B and 778 are primary well-differentiated and its recurrent liposarcoma cell lines; HOS and 143B are low-metastatic and high- metastatic (HOS with k-ras oncogene transformation) osteosarcoma cell lines, respectively. This synergistic effect was associated with additional down-regulation of phosphorylated STAT3.Conclusion: Although the second generation irreversible pan-HER inhibitor PF299804 inactivated HER family and downstream pathways, it encountered resistance at least partially due to the STAT3 activation. Therefore, addition of STAT3 inhibitor in PF299804 therapy may block STAT3 activation and achieve synergistic anti-proliferation in sarcoma cell lines.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8727096', '_score': 94.81499, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Molecular Sequence Data [D008969:minor]', 'P-Glycoprotein [D020168:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction [D016133:minor]/methods [Q000379:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Base Sequence [D001483:minor]', 'Blotting, Northern [D015152:minor]', 'DNA, Complementary [D018076:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple [D018432:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]'], 'text': 'Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of MDR1 gene expression in adult soft tissue sarcomas.\n\n\nExpression of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 is reported to be an important determinant of the response to chemotherapy and survival in some cancers. We compared three methods for determining the intrinsic MDR1 expression in soft tissue sarcomas. We studied MDR1 gene expression in 39 samples from 33 cases of soft tissue sarcomas comprising 11 liposarcomas, nine malignant fibrous histiocytomas, six leiomyosarcomas, four malignant schwannomas, three fibrosarcomas, three synovial sarcomas, and three epithelioid sarcomas, and seven cases of benign soft tissue tumors in adult patients. To detect MDR1 mRNA, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed in all samples. Furthermore, RNA dot-blot analysis with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe and immunohistochemistry with JSB-1 and C-219 antibodies for P-glycoprotein were employed in 34 and 37 samples in soft tissue sarcomas, respectively. We compared these three detection techniques. Of the 39 specimens, 18 (46%) showed MDR1 PCR products. Liposarcomas (six of 11), malignant fibrous histiocytomas (six of nine), leiomyosarcomas (four of six), fibrosarcomas (two of three) revealed high or intermediate MDR1 expression at high frequency. No MDR1 expression was detectable in malignant schwannomas, synovial sarcomas, or epithelioid sarcomas. Of seven benign soft tissue tumors, one ganglioneuroma and one lipomatosis showed low levels of MDR1 expression. By RNA dot-blot analysis, MDR1 transcripts were detectable in 12 of 34 specimens (35%). Four samples were negative by dot blot despite positivity with RT-PCR. Concordance between MDR1 expression by RNA level with RT-PCR and dot blot and at the protein level with immunohistochemistry using C-219 was found in 16 (47%) of the 34 comparable specimens. Eight samples showed positive immunoreactivity for C-219 despite negative results in RT-PCR and dot-blot analysis. The intrinsic MDR1 expression in soft tissue sarcoma seemed to depend on certain tumor types, such as liposarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, leiomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. For the evaluation of MDR1 expression, RT-PCR is useful because of its relative simplicity and sensitivity. However, the clinical significance of such low levels of MDR1 expression detected only by RT-PCR must be discussed within systematically treated patient groups.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_117415-132', '_score': 94.81499, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2013 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: A survey of thousands of tumor exomes and transcriptomes to expand clinical opportunities for crizotinib.\n\n\n\nBackground:  Cancer driver events occur as a result of chromosomal rearrangements. There are several examples where targeted inhibition of the resulting fusion produces dramatic clinical response. For example, the EML4-ALK fusion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Other ALK fusions have been described in NSCLC and other diseases including the NPM-ALK fusion in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The efficacy of crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors are being investigated in these diseases. ALK is also subject to activation via mutation and sensitivity to crizotinib is reported in ALK mutation positive neuroblastoma. Finally, crizotinib has activity not only against ALK, but also against ROS1, MST1R and MET. ROS1 fusions have been found in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and MET amplification events in gastric adenocarcinoma identify additional settings that may benefit from crizotinib treatment.   Methods:  To further understand the full therapeutic potential of Crizotinib, we undertook a genomic survey of ALK, ROS1, MET and MST1R across 1,000s of patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine.  Results:  We confirmed the presence of EML4-ALK fusions in both lung and colorectal cancer (CRC), and also identified a novel ALK fusion in CRC. ALK hotspot mutations and focal amplifications were confined to neuroblastoma, as previously described. Our survey of ROS1 identified rare novel fusions in NSCLC and glioblastoma, and high-level amplifications in liposarcoma (2%) and rarely in breast cancer (0.2%). No fusions were identified for MET, however high-level amplifications were observed in 1-5% of papillary renal cell carcinoma, the intestinal subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma, oliogodendroglioma, glioblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Hotspot mutations were frequently observed in squamous head and neck (11%), and more rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma, small cell lung and ovarian cancers.   Conclusions:   These results leverage all available genomic profiling data to provide a broadened scope of therapeutic opportunity for inhibitors like crizotinib. With the growing availability of next-generation sequencing, such surveys can support hypothesis-driven development of targeted therapies.\n \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '22749255', '_score': 94.28168, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate [D053208:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:minor]', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines [D044005:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Time Factors [D013997:minor]', 'Translocation, Genetic [D014178:major]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating [D018906:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic [D017322:minor]', 'Dioxoles [D004149:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Disease-Free Survival [D018572:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'A retrospective analysis of antitumour activity with trabectedin in translocation-related sarcomas.\n\n\nAIMS: Approximately 20% of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) have subtype-specific chromosomal translocations; these generate chimeric oncoproteins which can act as abnormal transcription factors. Since trabectedin can bind to DNA and displace transcription factors, antitumour activity was explored in translocation-related sarcoma (TRS) subtypes.\n\nMETHODS: The current retrospective pooled analysis includes data from 81 patients with TRS treated in 8 phase II trials.\n\nRESULTS: TRS subtypes were: synovial sarcoma (SS, n=45), myxoid-round cell liposarcoma (MRC-L-sarcoma, n=27), alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS, n=4), endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS, n=3) and clear cell sarcoma (CCS, n=2).

The tumor was centered by an ulcerated nodule with a diameter of around 10 centimeters. Imaging showed invasion of the soft tissue of the skin in the internal psoas muscle, the adipose tonality of which was compatible with a liposarcoma. The skin biopsy revealed characteristic bacterial grain in the center of a cholesterol granuloma. Subsequent culture in aerobic milieu identified Actinomyces gerencseriae. Cure was obtained following complete exeresis of the fibrous tissue and 8 months of antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid therapy.\n\nDISCUSSION: Other than the most unusual clinical aspect, the originality of this case of actinomycosis of the buttocks is based on its potential appendix origin, 4 years after acute appendicitis, with slow posterior fistulation.

In the era of oral molecular kinase inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are somewhat overlooked, but remain the backbone of treatment for most cancers. Patients with non-gastrointestinal stromal tumor sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (formerly called malignant fibrous histiocytoma), have received doxorubicin and ifosfamide as the backbone of their treatment for over 15 years or more. The goal of this article is to review the data that have led to the use of gemcitabine and docetaxel as a useful combination for patients with metastatic sarcomas, and to comment on possible synergy of the combination. Methods and results. The literature regarding the use of gemcitabine, docetaxel, or both, is reviewed, with emphasis on patients with metastatic sarcoma. Results. Activity of gemcitabine and docetaxel is observed in leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. There is apparent schedule dependence of the combination in other cancers; it is unclear if schedule matters in patients with sarcomas. The dose and schedule of gemcitabine and docetaxel examined in phase II studies are probably too high for routine practice. Conclusions. The combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel is an effective option for patients with metastatic sarcoma, increasing the armamentarium for the practicing oncologist in treating this heterogeneous group of diseases. Given the low response rate to docetaxel as a single agent, it is likely that there is true clinical synergy of the combination.

We demonstrated that additional domains of TAF15 contributed, albeit to a less prominent extent, to its subcellular localisation. In the carboxy-terminus we identified an arginine and glycine rich (RGG) domain, capable of being targeted to stress granules. We, moreover, showed that TAF15 cellular localisation depended on ongoing transcription and that independent domains of TAF15 engaged in nucleolar capping upon transcription inhibition. Finally, we demonstrated that TAF15 localisation was differentially regulated in the HeLa and the neuronal HT22 cell lines and that TAF15 co-localised with a minor subset of RNA granules in the cytoplasm of HT22 cells, supporting a model whereupon TAF15 plays a role in RNA transport and/or local RNA translation.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'AACR_2016-1284', '_score': 93.024925, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2016 AACR Annual Meeting\nTitle: Lurbinectedin reduces tumor-associated macrophages and the production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and angiogenic factors in preclinical models\n\n\nLurbinectedin, currently undergoing clinical evaluation in ovarian, breast and small-cell lung cancer patients, inhibits active transcription. The drug is structurally related to trabectedin containing the same pentacyclic skeleton of the fused tetrahydroisoquinoline rings, but differing by the presence of a tetrahydro-B-carboline replacing the additional tetrahydroisoquinoline of trabectedin. We investigated whether lurbinectedin has the ability to regulate the inflammatory tumor microenvironment in vitro and in vivo. Human purified monocytes were highly sensitive to lurbinectedin (IC50: 5-10 nM) and, after drug treatment, underwent caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, in vitro, lurbinectedin significantly inhibited the production of selected inflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CXCL8) and VEGF by stimulated monocytes and liposarcoma cell lines. Administration of lurbinectedin to mice bearing a murine fibrosarcoma -resistant to this compound in vitro- resulted in significant anti-tumor activity (T/C value around 50%). The analysis of immune cells of blood spleen and tumor tissues during treatment with lurbinectedin revealed a significant and selective decrease in the subset of monocytes and macrophages, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). A gene expression analysis of monocytes treated with lurbinectedin indicated a modulation of the transcriptional program in LPS-stimulated human monocytes. Overall, these results indicate that lurbinectedin affects the inflammatory micro-environment, with a selective apoptotic-inducing effect on mononuclear phagocytes and a specific inhibition of production of inflammatory cytokines.\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '26088650', '_score': 92.962204, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging [D008279:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Neoplasm Metastasis [D009362:minor]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed [D014057:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Tumor Burden [D047368:major]', 'Young Adult [D055815:minor]', 'Adrenal Gland Neoplasms [D000310:minor]/classification [Q000145:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Adrenalectomy [D000315:major]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aged, 80 and over [D000369:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Adrenal Imaging Features Predict Malignancy Better than Tumor Size.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION: In adrenal tumors, size ≥ 4 cm has been an indication for adrenalectomy due to concern for malignancy.

ImF was classified as nonbenign if HU > 10 on unenhanced CT scan or if loss of signal on out-of-phase imaging was absent on chemical-shift MRI.

Histologic malignancy occurred in 18 % (20/113) and included 3 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), 1 epithelioid liposarcoma, 1 lymphoma, 1 malignant nerve sheath tumor, and 14 adrenal metastases. Patients with malignancies were older (mean age, 60 ± 13 vs. 51 ± 14 years, p = 0.01). Malignant tumors were larger on preoperative imaging (mean 5.3 ± 3.2 vs. 3.9 ± 2.4 cm, p = 0.03).

Spontaneous tumors, however, were found to arise in untreated females and showed the same characteristics. Tumor growth was dependent upon or influenced by estrogen when assessed in estrogenized and unconditioned hosts. Intermitten estrogenization was effective, but tumor growth took place more slowly. The type of response observed led to a new classification of five types of hormone-responsive tumors including tumors inhibited by estrogen. Estrogen-dependent tumor cells might remain dormant indefinitely and not grow in unconditioned animals until stimulated to grow by estrogen. The growth rate of hormone-dependent adrenal carcinomas was related to the amount of estrogen. Tumor growth started more rapidly in the presence of low estrogen dose levels in old rats used as hosts than it did in young rats. Breast carcinomas required the largest amount of estrogen for growth, whereas ovarian thecomas would grow in normal females but not in males. The growth rate in conditioned hosts of most transplanted tumors (some have maintained hormone dependency over 10 years) increased over successive generations. Progression, however, towards a more autonomous state after repeated transplantations was remarkably slow, and a sudden change to autonomy was rarely noted. In contrast, transplants of 9,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-induced mammary carcinomas progressed rapidly to autonomy.

ALS is, however, increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder associated with impaired cognition. The overlap between ALS and dementia at clinical, genetic and neuropathologic levels indicates a spectrum of clinical phenotypes that may include features of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Most cases of ALS are sporadic (SALS), but approximately 10% of all ALS cases are familial ALS (FALS). Mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 gene (SOD-1) occur in about 20% of FALS cases. Mutations in the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 gene (TARDBP or TDP-43) may occur in 3-4% of FALS cases, and less frequently, in FTLD. Recently, mutations in the fused in sarcoma/translation in liposarcoma gene (FUS/TLS) were identified as causing about 4-5% of FALS, SALS, and FTLD cases, but not SOD-1 ALS cases, indicating a pathogenic role of FUS, together with TDP-43, in possibly all types of ALS, except for SOD-1 linked ALS. TDP-43 and FUS have striking structural and functional similarities, most likely implicating altered RNA processing as a major event in ALS pathogenesis. Thus, TARDBP and FUS/TLS mutations define a novel class of neurodegenerative diseases called TDP-43- and FUS-proteinopathies, in which both misfolded proteins are novel targets for the development of therapeutics in this spectrum of diseases.

Aberrant MDM2 signaling is an alternate mechanism to inactivate wild type (WT) p53. In preclinical studies, DS-3032b disrupted the MDM2-WTp53 interaction resulting in cell cycle arrest, senescence and/or apoptosis. We characterized the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and efficacy of DS-3032b in a phase 1 trial. Methods: Using accelerated and Bayesian design in the dose-escalation phase of this 2-part study (part 1), we escalated DS-3032b from 15 to 240 mg orally once daily (QD) on a continuous or interrupted (QD 21/28 days) schedule. Results: Thirty-one of 34 pts enrolled in part 1 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Median age was 59.5 years, 44% male, and 62% had  3 prior therapies. The majority of pts (79%) had wt TP53 and the most frequent tumor type was well/de-differentiated liposarcoma (LPS; n = 15). MTD was 120 mg (interrupted) and 90 mg (continuous) schedule. The most common drug-related adverse events were hematologic and gastrointestinal. Six pts had DLTs, 5 were due to thrombocytopenia alone or with neutropenia. Of 26 pts evaluable for efficacy, none had an objective response but 77% had stable disease (SD); consistent with cell cycle arrest/senescence seen in preclinical studies. Tumor shrinkage was seen but did not meet RECIST criteria. Two pts with previously progressing LPS and carcinoid remain on study for 26+ mos and tumor sequencing showed MDM2 gene amplification. Exposures of DS-3032b were significantly higher in pts with lower body weight. Induction of MIC- 1 (PD biomarker of WT p53 reactivation) correlated with drug exposure. Conclusions: DS-3032b has an acceptable safety profile at the MTD of 120 mg (QD 21/28). Clinical benefit with durable SD was seen in tumors with aberrant MDM2 signaling and WT p53. MDM2 is universally amplified in LPS and TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer; warranting further investigation of DS-3032b.

Age ranged from 16 to 77 years (median, 48.6 years). Of the patients, 16 had primary disease and 8 recurrent disease. Histologic diagnoses were as follows: malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 6, liposarcoma in 3, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in 3, Ewing/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) in 2, and miscellaneous in 10 patients. The histologic grades were as follows: Grade 3 in 15, Grade 2-3 in 2, Grade 2 in 3, and unknown in 4. Clinical target volumes ranged between 57 cm(3) and 1,194 cm(3) (median 525 cm(3)).

Recently, miRNA-155 (miR-155) has been proved to play a substantial role in liposarcoma and breast cancer, but its functions in the context of PTC remain unknown.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the potential involvement of miR-155 in PTC.\n\nDESIGN: Expression levels of miR-155 were assessed via quantitative real-time PCR in 20 pairs of human PTC and adjacent normal tissues and in 4 human PTC cell lines. Lentiviral miR-155 overexpression models were performed in TPC-1 and CGTH-W3 cells, and the effects on cell growth were evaluated. We have searched for miR-155 targets and identified the hypothesis that miR-155 could promote tumor growth of PTC by targeted regulation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) expression and activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling.\n\nRESULTS: MiR-155 levels were markedly increased in PTC specimens and PTC cell lines. Overexpression of miR-155 dramatically promoted PTC cell viability and colony formation in vitro, whereas miR-155 depletion reduced these parameters. Further studies revealed that APC is a novel miR-155 target, because miR-155 bound directly to its 3'-untranslated region and reduced both the mRNA and protein levels of APC. Similar to the miR-155 over-expression, APC downregulation promoted cell growth, whereas rescued APC expression reversed the promotive effect of miR-155. Furthermore, miR-155 overexpression resulted in activation of β-catenin and induction of several downstream genes including c-Myc, cyclin D1, TCF-1. and LEF-1. Depletion of β-catenin partially prevented miR-155-induced tumor cell viability and colony formation. In xenograft animal experiments, we found overexpressed miR-155 effectively promoted tumor growth of PTC cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that miR-155 functions as an oncogene in PTC. By targeting APC, miR-155 efficiently regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling. And miR-155 may be a potential therapeutic or diagnostic/prognostic target for treating PTC."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27387325', '_score': 91.19452, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': 'A phase II trial comparing pazopanib with doxorubicin as first-line treatment in elderly patients with metastatic or advanced soft tissue sarcoma (EPAZ): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Anthracycline-based treatment remains the backbone of chemotherapy for nonresectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS). More than 30 % of patients with STS are aged 60 years or older, limiting the choice of treatment to single-agent approaches for this elderly population. Hematological toxicity is frequent during doxorubicin monotherapy, grade 4 neutropenia is reported in 34 %, with a febrile neutropenia rate of 9 % in STS. We assume that comorbidities in the elderly population may limit tolerability of doxorubicin, and novel agents may improve tolerability and health-related quality of life while maintaining efficacy. We therefore investigated whether the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib exerts such a clinical benefit in elderly patients with STS (pazopanib for elderly [the EPAZ study]).\n\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase II noninferiority trial in which pazopanib 800 mg once daily is being compared six cycles of intravenous doxorubicin 75 mg/m(2) as first-line treatment in elderly patients (≥60 years) with metastatic or advanced STS. A total of 120 patients will be randomized 1:2 to receive doxorubicin or pazopanib, stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 vs. 2) and liposarcoma histology (yes vs. no). The primary endpoint is progression-free survival based on local tumor assessment according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Secondary endpoints include grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia in hierarchical order, as well as overall survival, objective response rate, health-related quality of life, and geriatric assessments.\n\nDISCUSSION: Pazopanib is associated with promising tolerability according to previous studies and may offer a significant clinical advantage in first-line treatment of STS compared with doxorubicin. The elderly population seems especially appealing for such an approach, since these patients are not suitable for aggressive combination therapy. The EPAZ study will confirm whether pazopanib may be an alternative to toxic chemotherapy for elderly patients with STS.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01861951 ; registered on 11 April 2013.

The location and morphologic characteristics of SCL were documented as well.\n\nRESULTS: Six lesions were well-defined and located in the subcutaneous fat of the posterior neck (n = 4), anterior neck (n = 1), and buccal space (n = 1). One lesion was ill-defined and located deeply in the supraclavicular fossa, infiltrating the adjacent shoulder muscles. Intratumoral fat was identified in five lesions in various amounts. Compared with the adjacent subcutaneous fat, intratumoral fat was slightly hyperattenuated on CT scans and slightly hypointense on T1-weighted MR images.

Based on this strong rationale a Phase I trial was designed to exploit this finding in late stage solid tumors.Methods: We designed a phase I study to determine the safety of intratumoral injection of activated DC by administering the product repeatedly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, in advanced cancers. Endpoints included maximum tolerated (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLT), safety, and immune response criteria (iRC) and RECIST. The treatment consisted of image-guided intratumoral (IT) injections of autologous, activated dendritic cells (DCVax-Direct,). Injections were given on days 0, 7 and 14, followed by booster immunizations at weeks 4, 8 and 16. Three dose levels, at 2 million, 6 million or 15 million DC per injection, were tested. Concomitant, serial biopsies were performed at the time of the vaccination in the absence of toxicity /progression. Systemic immune responses were tracked through evaluation of T cell subsets and cytokines in circulation, and through T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing in the tumor tissue and in the periphery.Results: To date, 40 patients (men, n = 18; women, n = 22), median age 53.7 (range 30 - 73) years, median of 3.1 (1 - 6) prior therapies (including 1 patient with prior immune therapy) were enrolled. Seventeen patients were treated at the 2 million dose level, 19 at the 6 million dose level, and 3 at 15 million. The MTD has not been reached and there were no dose limiting toxicities. Two patients experienced Grade 3/4 drug related toxicities : one case of fever and dehydration and one case of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Patterns of immunological reactivity were assessed by pathological scoring on tumor biopsies for 29 patients, and included increasing necrosis in 62% of patients and emergence or amplification of infiltrating T cells in 55%. In-depth study was carried out in a patient with therapy-refractory, de-differentiated liposarcoma whose imaging at 12 weeks post initial injection revealed necrosis in the primary tumor and stable lung metastases. Biopsies demonstrated an intra-tumoral inflammatory response consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages and TIA-1 expressing cells, suggesting cytolytic activity. TCR sequencing revealed the presence of shared TCR sequences in the tumor as well as in circulation, demonstrating a systemic anti-tumor response. Analysis of T cell subsets in circulation demonstrated normalization of the CD4/CD8ratio.Conclusion:Immunotherapy with partially activated DC's injected IT demonstrate early signals of immune reactivity even in late stage patients with cancer. Preliminary data support the generation of anti-tumor effects following IT injection of the partially activated, autologous DCs.\n"}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '2837562', '_score': 90.238144, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular [D006528:major]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/microbiology [Q000382:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens [D006514:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Liver Neoplasms [D008113:major]/diagnosis [Q000175:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/microbiology [Q000382:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Primary malignant tumor of liver in infants and children in Taiwan.\n\n\nDuring the years 1976 through 1985, 55 cases of primary malignant tumor of liver in infants and children were treated.

The original stem cell has not been identified yet, but such tumours constantly present the expression of the surface antigens CD34 and CD117 which can be determined immunohisto-chemically. US endoscopy and fine needle aspiration with subsequent immunohistochemical analysis and study of c-kit gene mutation afford the best diagnostic accuracy. Current research is focused mainly on primary cells, probably the cells of Cajal, and on the study of the biological behaviour of gastrointestinal stromal tumours, which can be postulated by assessing several parameters, the most accurate of which seems to be the mitotic index. More recently, the possible therapeutic use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor has been studied in tumours expressing the c-kit gene. Our experience is based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical study of 11 submucosal tumours (1 liposarcoma, 2 leiomiomas, and 8 gastrointestinal stromal tumours) out of a total of 75 submucosal tumours diagnosed. In the majority of cases a generic diagnosis of submucosal tumour was obtained with oesophagogastro-duodenoscopy and a surgical resection was then performed because of the symptoms. Only in 4 cases was the neoplasm found occasionally in the course of surgery for other reasons. The definitive diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour, as currently defined, was made only postoperatively by analysis of the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. In all cases we evaluated the same parameters, i.e. actin, vimentine, S100, CD34, CD117, and Ki67, and confirmed constant high positivity for CD34 and above all for CD117.

These diseases now are collectively known as the novel clinical spectrum, FUS proteinopathy. ALS-linked mutations of FUS are clustered in the C-terminal region; however, the molecular properties of mutant FUS remain unclear. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of FUS proteinopathy, we examined the biochemical and cellular characteristics of mutant FUS in expressing cells.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Expression of ALS-linked FUS mutations resulted in their assembly into cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), cellular structures that package mRNA and RNA-binding proteins during cell stress. A deletion mutant series revealed that the C-terminal region in FUS is critical for nuclear retention via Ran guanosine triphosphatase-dependent transport machinery. A parallel study of subcellular distribution revealed that ALS-linked mutants additively disturb the function of the C-terminus for nuclear traffic, resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation and the formation of SGs.\n\nINTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that mutant FUS, which is missing the nuclear traffic activity of the C-terminus, is dislocated to cytoplasm and assembled into SGs, indicating that disruption of translational regulation and metabolism of mRNA via inappropriate/excessive SGs may be crucial for FUS proteinopathies. Our findings provide new biological and pathological insights into the FUS protein that should help our understanding of the pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '17256128', '_score': 89.7329, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]', 'Asparaginase [D001215:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Caspases [D020169:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug [D004305:minor]', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor [D004354:minor]', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase [D005974:minor]/antagonists & inhibitors [Q000037:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Methionine Sulfoximine [D008717:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/enzymology [Q000201:major]'], 'text': 'The inhibition of glutamine synthetase sensitizes human sarcoma cells to L-asparaginase.\n\n\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the activity of the antitumor enzyme L: -asparaginase (ASNase) on tumor cells of mesenchymal origin and the contribution of glutamine synthetase (GS) to the adaptation to the metabolic stress caused by the anti-tumor enzyme.\n\nMETHODS: We studied the effects of ASNase in six human sarcoma cell lines: HT1080 (fibrosarcoma); RD (rhabdomyosarcoma); SW872 (liposarcoma); HOS, SAOS-2, and U2OS (osteosarcoma) in the absence or in the presence of the GS inhibitor methionine L: -sulfoximine (MSO).\n\nRESULTS: HT1080 and SW872 cells were highly sensitive to ASNase-dependent cytotoxicity. In contrast, RD, SAOS-2, HOS, and U2OS cells exhibited only a partial growth suppression upon treatment with the anti-tumor enzyme.

Adipocytes produce numerous bioactive substances, and their dysregulation has serious pathophysiological consequences. We previously reported that human adipose tissue from several depots produces significant amounts of prolactin (PRL). To study locally produced PRL, we sought an acceptable in vitro model. Consequently, we developed an adipocyte cell line derived from a metastatic liposarcoma. The cell line, designated LS14, has been in continuous culture for 2 yr. These cells exhibit many properties of primary preadipocytes, including the ability to undergo terminal differentiation, as judged by morphological alterations, lipid accumulation, and increase in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. LS14 cells express many adipose-associated genes, such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP(2)), hormone-sensitive lipase, lipoprotein lipase, preadipocyte factor 1, adiponectin, leptin, and IL-6. Similar to primary adipocytes, LS14 cells also produce and respond to PRL, thus making them an attractive model to study adipose PRL production and function. The expression of PRL was confirmed at the transcriptional level by RT-PCR, and PRL secretion was determined by the Nb2 bioassay.

McDonnell, P. Lau, R. Milne, and R. McPherson. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 23572;-23577). In contrast to other major sterol-responsive genes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase CETP expression is up-regulated rather than down-regulated in response to cholesterol. To define elements involved in cholesterol-mediated up-regulation of CETP gene expression, deletion derivatives of the CETP promoter were cloned into a luciferase reporter construct and transfected into the human liposarcoma cell line SW872, cultured in the presence or absence of lipoproteins. A fragment associated with a positive cholesterol response was identified between nucleotides -361 and -138 (relative to the initiation site of transcription) of the promoter. This region contains a tandem repeat of a sequence known to mediate sterol dependent regulation of the hamster HMG-CoA reductase gene. We have putatively denoted this region, the cholesterol response element (CRE). Using gel mobility shift assays we demonstrate that both YY1 and SREBP-1 interact with the CRE of CETP. Furthermore, in transient co-transfection experiments, both YY1 and SREBP-1a were found to trans-activate, in a dose-dependent manner, the luciferase activity of constructs harboring the CRE. We also demonstrate that SREBP-2, is able to trans-activate a luciferase construct harboring the CRE although much less effectively as compared to SREBP-1. Finally, functional analysis of the CRE confirms its regulatory role in modulating CETP gene expression through its interaction with YY1 and SREBP-1a.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '17146434', '_score': 89.07358, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Imidazoles [D007093:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Mice [D051379:minor]', 'Nuclear Proteins [D009687:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Piperazines [D010879:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2 [D019253:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2 [D051736:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Transcription, Genetic [D014158:minor]', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured [D014407:minor]', 'Tumor Protein p73 [D000072160:minor]', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53 [D016159:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/genetics [Q000235:major]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins [D025521:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Apoptosis [D017209:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Carboplatin [D016190:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Cisplatin [D002945:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'DNA-Binding Proteins [D004268:minor]/drug effects [Q000187:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor [D050687:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]'], 'text': 'Mouse double minute antagonist Nutlin-3a enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in cancer cells with mutant p53 by activating E2F1.\n\n\nMDM2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Recently, small-molecule antagonists of MDM2, the Nutlins, have been developed to inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction and activate p53 signaling. However, half of human cancers have mutated p53 and they are resistant to Nutlin treatment. Here, we report that treatment of the p53-mutant malignant peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST) and p53-null HCT116 cells with cisplatin (Cis) and Nutlin-3a induced a degree of apoptosis that was significantly greater than either drug alone. Nutlin-3a also increased the cytotoxicity of both carboplatin and doxorubicin in a series of p53-mutant human tumor cell lines. In the human dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell line (LS141) and the p53 wild-type HCT116 cells, Nutlin-3a induced downregulation of E2F1 and this effect appeared to be proteasome dependent. In contrast, in MPNST and HCTp53-/- cells, Nutlin-3a inhibited the binding of E2F1 to MDM2 and induced transcriptional activation of free E2F1 in the presence of Cis-induced DNA damage. Downregulation of E2F1 by small interfering RNA significantly decreased the level of apoptosis induced by Cis and Nutlin-3a treatment. Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of E2F1 rescued cells from apoptosis, whereas cells overexpressing wild-type E2F1 showed an increase in cell death. This correlated with the induction of the proapoptotic proteins p73alpha and Noxa, which are both regulated by E2F1. These results indicate that antagonism of MDM2 by Nutlin-3a in cells with mutant p53 enhances chemosensitivity in an E2F1-dependent manner. Nutlin-3a therefore may provide a therapeutic benefit in tumors with mutant p53 provided it is combined with chemotherapy.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '2237900', '_score': 88.73642, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Combined Modality Therapy [D003131:minor]', 'Myxoma [D009232:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Papilloma [D010212:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Rhabdomyoma [D012207:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Heart Neoplasms [D006338:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Incidence [D015994:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Minnesota [D008910:minor]/epidemiology [Q000453:minor]'], 'text': 'Primary cardiac tumors: experience at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\nA review of all primary cardiac tumors seen at the University of Minnesota or entered in the Registry of Cardiovascular Disease, affiliated with the University of Minnesota, between 1959 and 1989.

Its main subgroups, WD/DD, is known to be poorly sensitive to chemotherapy, with few active agents, i.e., anthracyclines +/- ifosfamide and trabectedin. High-dose ifosfamide (HDIFX >12 g/m2) is active in STS pts pretreated with standard-dose IFX, though with greater toxicity. A prolonged continuous-infusion (ci) through a portable external pump may be an alternative way to administer HDIFX.\n\nMETHODS: From March 2002 to August 2013, 28 pts (median age =60, range =37-73 yrs) with advanced disease (6 WD and 22 WD/DD) were given ciHDIFX, at the dose of 14 g/m2 as a 14-day continuous infusion every 4 weeks. Twenty-four pts (86%) were previously treated with chemotherapy (19 with anthracyclines and ifosfamide; 4 with anthracycline monotherapy; 1 with trabectedin).\n\nRESULTS: Seven PR (all in DDLPS), 2 minor response (MR) and 11 SD were observed.

Methods: Pts received MLN8237 PO once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) for 7 days (d) followed by a 14d recovery period. Tumor and skin biopsies were done serially to evaluate bioactivity measured by mitotic index and chromosome and spindle abnormalities in mitotic cells. Doses were increased in cohorts of 3-6 pts until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluated in the first cycle was seen in 2 pts in a cohort. Results: As of 12-Dec-08, 27 pts received MLN8237 (median 2 cycles, range 1-10+); median age was 57 yr (range 31-78). The first cohort received 5mg QD. Higher QD doses were safe in another Phase 1 study (Infante et al, EJC Suppl 2008;6[12]:90), so subsequent cohorts in this study started at 80mg QD (Table). DLTs at 60-100mg PO BID included neutropenia, pancytopenia, stomatitis, and somnolence. Somnolence (of any grade) was seen with QD dosing, but was reduced with divided doses each <100 mg. Antitumor activity was seen in a pt in cohort 4 with a large treatment-resistant pleomorphic liposarcoma. Preliminary PK analyses showed dose-dependent increases in AUC0-24 and Cmax. Consistent with Aurora A inhibition, increased mitotic index in skin and tumor biopsies after MLN8237 dosing was coupled with decreased bipolar spindles and aligned chromosomes in mitotic cells from tumor biopsies. Conclusions: At the doses and schedule evaluated, MLN8237 is tolerable with BID dosing x7d and exhibits favorable PK, PD, and clinical antitumor activity.

Ultrasonic examination, computed tomography (CT) scan, cystoscopy and biopsy is used for diagnosis of the tumor. Seventeen of 28 patients (61.7%) were malignant neoplasms in 7 kinds of pathologic types, which was small cell carcinoma (5 cases), rhabdomyosarcoma (4 cases), leiomyosarcoma (4 cases), lymphoma (1 case), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (1 case), liposarcoma(1 case), melanoma (1 case) respectively. Eleven of 28 patients (39.3%) were benign tumors with 4 kinds of histologic types including 2 cases of cavernous hemangioma, 1 case of fibroma, 1 case of leiomyoma, 7 cases of pheochromocytoma. All benign tumor patients were treated with partial cystectomy, transurethral bladder tumor resect (TURBT) and fulguration. In 17 malignant neoplasms patients, 7 of them received partial cystectomy, 9 received radical cystectomy, and 1 patient's tumor was unresectable.

This study investigates the efficacy and toxicity of daily oral etoposide in chemotherapy for non-heavily pretreated advanced and metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS).Subjects. Twenty-seven patients with progressive and measurable disease were treated. Median age was 53 years (range 20-71 years) and performance status WHO 0 or 1. Histologies included mainly leiomyosarcoma (8), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (4), rhabdomyosarcoma (4), liposarcoma (2) and synovial sarcoma (2). Fifteen patients had received prior radiotherapy, of whom three included sites with haematopoiesis. All patients had received prior chemotherapy, including adjuvant therapy (7) and mostly consisted of one two-drug schedule (ifosfamide and doxorubicin) or two single-drug regimens.Methods. Chemotherapy consisted of etoposide (VP16-213), 50 mg m(-2) day(-1) x 21 q 4 weeks. Blood cell counts were done weekly. Dose reductions and a maximum delay of 2 weeks was allowed depending on cell counts during treatment and at the start of a new 4-week treatment cycle.Results. No objective response was observed. Progressive disease was observed after two treatment cycles in 17/27 patients (68%) and after three cycles in 22/27 patients (81%). The other patients received three to five cycles. Twenty-four patients went off study due to progressive disease. Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in eight and one patients, respectively. Thrombocytopenia grade 3 was seen in two patients. Non-haematological toxicity grade 3 (nausea, diarrhoea or alopecia) was observed in three patients, and grade 4 (dyspnea, hypotension or haemorrhage) in three patients.Discussion. No objective response was obtained. Oral etoposide at a dose of 50 mg m(-2) day(-1) x 21 q 4 weeks is inactive in chemotherapy of pretreated STS.

Lack of experimental models and limited clinical accessibility constitute major obstacles to the molecular characterization of dormant tumors. We have developed models in which human tumors remain dormant for a prolonged period of time (>120 days) until they switch to rapid growth and become strongly angiogenic. These angiogenic tumors retain their ability to grow fast once injected in new mice. We hypothesized that dormant tumors undergo a stable genetic reprogramming during their switch to the fast-growing phenotype. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis was done to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the switch of dormant breast carcinoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, and liposarcoma tumors. A consensus expression signature distinguishing all four dormant versus switched fast-growing tumors was generated. In alignment with our phenotypic observation, the angiogenesis process was the most significantly affected functional gene category. The switch of dormant tumors was associated with down-regulation of angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin and decreased sensitivity of angiogenic tumors to angiostatin. The conversion of dormant tumors to exponentially growing tumors was also correlated with regulation and activation of pathways not hitherto linked to tumor dormancy process, such as endothelial cell-specific molecule-1, 5'-ecto-nucleotidase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. Further, novel dormancy-specific biomarkers such as H2BK and Eph receptor A5 (EphA5) were discovered. EphA5 plasma levels in mice and mRNA levels in tumor specimens of glioma patients correlated with diseases stage. These data will be instrumental in identifying novel early cancer biomarkers and could provide a rationale for development of dormancy-promoting tumor therapy strategies."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '15631540', '_score': 87.54121, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols [D000971:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic [D017321:minor]', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic [D017322:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Neoplasm Metastasis [D009362:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Salvage Therapy [D016879:major]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]/pathology [Q000473:major]'], 'text': "Recent developments in salvage chemotherapy for patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n\nThe number of effective cytotoxic agents for the treatment of patients with metastatic adult soft tissue sarcoma is limited, especially when patients have failed anthracycline- and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy.

Small round cell tumours (SRCTs), such as Ewing's sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumour, desmoplastic SRCT and rhabdomyosarcoma, are chemotherapy-sensitive and potentially curable malignancies, which are treated with multimodality, dose-intensive, neoadjuvant protocols regardless of size or overt metastatic disease.

A high activity has been reported for the taxanes, in particular for paclitaxel, in vascular sarcomas located in the scalp or face and in Kaposi's sarcoma.

The malignant potential is unclear. The question is whether to remove both kidneys in patients with a tumor on one side only diagnosed by computed tomography (CT).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Kidney tumors were found in 14 patients with ESKD from January 2002 to December 2006. One was unfit for surgery. Thirteen patients underwent nephrectomy and 6 a bilateral procedure of whom only 2 had bilateral tumors on CT, 3 multiple tumors on the contralateral side, and 1 uncontrollable hypertension with tumors as an incidental finding. Tumors were found in all 19 specimens.\n\nRESULTS: In 13 kidneys (68.4%), the tumors were multiple; in 6 (31.6%), solitary. The types of tumor were: 13 (68.4%) papillary RCCs (PRCC), 9 (47.4%) clear RCCs (CRCC), a combination of PRCC and CRCC in 4 (21.0%), and myxoid liposarcoma (with solitary PRCC contralaterally). The mean follow-up was short (19 +/- 15 months; maximum, 54 months). Only 1 patient died due to a tumor at 16 months after operation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is a high risk for bilateral involvement. Patients who undergo unilateral nephrectomy must be regularly followed and contralateral nephrectomy carefully considered, mainly in transplanted patients on immunosuppression. Further studies are needed to give a definitive answer about the indications for surgery and the indications for contralateral nephrectomy as well.

Thirty-three cases (22 malignant lesions, 11 benign lesions) in which CMS was a prominent feature of the smears were studied. The most common malignant neoplasms were extraskeletal chondrosarcoma (6 cases), myxoid liposarcoma (6), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (5).

They may be associated with an endocrine disorder such as Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, or hyperaldosteronism; however they are most often discovered incidentally. Their size is usually less than 5 cm and they are managed nonoperatively. We report a case of bilateral giant adrenal myelolipoma producing abdominal pain in a 54-year-old man, who presented to his primary care physician with complaints of right shoulder pain with vague abdominal discomfort. Imaging studies identified bilateral suprarenal masses measuring 12 x 14 cm on the right and 8 x 10 cm on the left. These masses were consistent with fatty tissue radiographically. In addition a focal 5 x 4-cm mass was identified in the transverse colon. Because the patient was symptomatic and a diagnosis of liposarcoma could not be excluded he was taken to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with excision of the masses and a transverse colectomy.

We present our experience in light of scarce information available on the clinical manifestations of RTs. The retrospective study included 17 patients diagnosed as RTs between January 2004 and January 2014. Demographic characteristics, length of symptoms, clinical findings, diagnostic methods, evaluations on the treatment procedures and postoperative periods, pathology, complications, and length of hospital stay were recorded. A mean of 1.7 of patients were diagnosed with RTs annually in our hospital. Patients comprised 12 females and 5 males. Pain and discomfort were the most common symptoms at presentation. All the lesions were evaluated by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), and all the patients were treated operatively. Based on the preoperative MRI or CT findings, an anterior approach was performed in 7 patients, a posterior approach in 6 patients, and combined approach in 4 patients. Mean size of tumors was 9.2 ± 4.3 cm. Epidermoid cyst (n = 8) was the most common tumor. Except for 1 case of liposarcoma, 16 tumors were confirmed to be of benign nature in histologic examination. Mean length of hospital stay 12.4 ± 6.8 days. Retrorectal tumors are heterogeneous and lead to diagnostic difficulties. A high index of clinical suspicion is needed for diagnosis. Preoperative imaging may be helpful in determining the course of treatment.

One such entity is lipoblastoma, which is a benign lipomatous tumour that often exhibits rearrangements of chromosome bands 8q11-13, and the gene PLAG1 has been implicated as the target of these chromosomal changes. All lipomatous tumours karyotyped at the Norwegian Radium Hospital were reviewed, looking for rearrangements of 8q11-13. Five tumours exhibiting chromosomal abnormalities affecting this region were found. Only one of them was morphologically diagnosed as a lipoblastoma, two being classified as lipomas, one as a hibernoma, and one as a well-differentiated liposarcoma. The two tumours successfully analysed with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) covering the gene PLAG1 showed involvement of this gene in the rearrangement. The findings raise the question as to what extent the diagnosis lipoblastoma should be based on histopathological or cytogenetic/molecular data or a combination thereof. When karyotypic information from this series was combined with available literature data, it was found that the sensitivity of 8q11-13 rearrangements for diagnosing lipoblastomas when found in a lipomatous tumour was 77% and that the corresponding specificity was 98%. The validity of these calculations of the diagnostic information provided by the cytogenetic findings is, of course, totally dependent on the morphological diagnosis made in each case. Regardless of what the precise phenotypic diagnosis was, it is suggested that lipomatous tumours with 8q11-13 rearrangement constitute a distinct pathogenetic entity. When selective therapies tailor-made against the specific pathogenetic rearrangement become available, it will become mandatory to pay more attention to the genetic constitution of the tumour cells than to their phenotypic appearance.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '20049928', '_score': 87.15387, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adolescent [D000293:minor]', 'Neoplasm Staging [D009367:minor]', 'Prognosis [D011379:minor]', 'Retrospective Studies [D012189:minor]', 'Teratoma [D013724:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Child [D002648:minor]', 'Child, Preschool [D002675:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Infant [D007223:minor]', 'Infant, Newborn [D007231:minor]', 'Italy [D007558:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]'], 'text': 'Teratoma with a malignant somatic component in pediatric patients: the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP) experience.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Teratoma with a malignant somatic component (TMSC) is rare but described in adults, whereas information on pediatric presentation is sparse.\n\nPROCEDURE: The Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica identified 14 cases of TMSC. Clinical files and pathology specimens were reviewed.\n\nRESULTS: The series (9 female, 5 male) showed the following disease: testis (2), sacrococcygeal (3), ovary (3), retroperitoneum (3), mediastinum (2), and foot soft tissue (1). Distribution of the somatic component was: carcinoma (4), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (1), neuroblastoma (3), rhabdomyosarcoma (3), rhabdomyosarcoma plus liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma (1), chondrosarcoma plus neuroectodermal sarcoma (1), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (1). Three patients were in stage I, four in stage II, three in stage III, and four in stage IV. All but one patient underwent surgery and only females showed carcinoma components. Nine patients relapsed or progressed and eight died. Six patients are alive and disease-free. Two patients underwent complete resection and four were treated based on transformed histologies.

The pediatric disease appears to be more heterogeneous in tumor site distribution and MSC histology than in adults. Our series suggests no effects of age, histology, or gender on outcome.

Of the 22 cases with abnormal karyotype, nine (41%) cases showed recurring aberrations: Ewing's sarcomas (n=2), desmoplastic small round cell tumour (n=1), synovial sarcomas (n=3), myxoid liposarcomas (n=2), and lipoma (n=1). One lipoma case had a t(2;12)(q23;q15) in which 2q23 breakpoint was not reported before.

In 17 patients various symptoms were seen and in 4 the mass was incidentally detected. A mass was palpable on digital rectal examination in 16 cases and visible on sonography in 20. For a cystic mass medial location relative to the bladder neck was suggestive of prostatic abscess or utricle cyst, while lateral location was suggestive of seminal vesicle cyst/hydrops or empyema, ectopic ureter or ureterocele.

A variable proportion of patients develop periprosthetic soft-tissue masses or pseudotumors at the site of the implant. There is a concern that exposure to increased metal ions could increase the risk of cancer. In order to investigate whether the periprosthetic soft-tissue mass harbours any cancer- related genetic alterations, we studied DNA isolated from periprosthetic tissues of 20 patients with MoM hip replacement, for copy number alterations and mutations in hotspot regions of 50 cancer genes using aCGH and amplicon-based next generation sequencing. Our results showed copy number gains at 12q14.3 and 21q21.1in tumour from patient diagnosed with liposarcoma.

The authors conducted a multi-institutional phase 2 trial of the monoclonal antibody R1507 in patients with various subtypes of recurrent or refractory sarcomas.\n\nMETHODS: Eligibility criteria included age ≥ 2 years and a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory RMS, OS, SS, and other soft tissue sarcomas. Patients received a weekly dose of 9 mg/kg R1507 intravenously. The primary endpoint was the best objective response rate using World Health Organization criteria. Tumor imaging was performed every 6 weeks × 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter.\n\nRESULTS: From December 2007 through August 2009, 163 eligible patients from 33 institutions were enrolled. The median patient age was 31 years (range, 7-85 years). Histologic diagnoses included OS (n = 38), RMS (n = 36), SS (n = 23), and other sarcomas (n = 66). The overall objective response rate was 2.5% (95% confidence interval, 0.7%-6.2%). Partial responses were observed in 4 patients, including 2 patients with OS, 1 patient with RMS, and 1 patient with alveolar soft part sarcoma. Four additional patients (3 with RMS and 1 with myxoid liposarcoma) had a ≥ 50% decrease in tumor size that lasted for <4 weeks. The median progression-free survival was 5.7 weeks, and the median overall survival was 11 months. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were metabolic (12%), hematologic (6%), gastrointestinal (4%), and general constitutional symptoms (8%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: R1507 is safe and well tolerated but has limited activity in patients with recurrent or refractory bone and soft tissue sarcomas.

Methods: Patients (pts) with advanced refractory solid tumors were dosed once daily (QD) d1-5 in a 14-day cycle in sequential cohorts of 3-6 pts with 50 or 100% dose increments. Primary objectives were to determine safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 4SC-201. Pharmacodynamic assessment (histone acetylation and HDAC enzyme activity) and anti-tumor efficacy were secondary objectives. Blood samples for PK and PD were taken on days 1, 5 and 47 of treatment. Results: 18 pts (9M/9F) with a median age of 58.5 yrs (range 40-70) were treated at five dose levels: 3 pts each at 100mg, 200mg, 400mg and 600mg and 6 pts at 800mg. All pts were evaluable for toxicity and received at least 2 treatment cycles. Grade 3 DLT of nausea and vomiting occurred in 1 pt dosed at 800mg. Most common adverse events included nausea, vomiting and fatigue. 8 of 9 pts treated in the 600mg and 800mg cohorts had stable disease during the main phase of the study (4 treatment cycles). A patient with liposarcoma and another with thymoma (marginal response) continued treatment beyond 6 months. PK parameters were dose-proportional with a low inter-individual variability and indicated good bioavailability. The apparent t1/2 of oral 4SC-201 ranged from 2.3 to 4.4 hours. The degree of HDAC inhibition measured in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell functional assay was dose- dependent and increased from 50 to 100 %, although histone H4 acetylation accumulation after dosing did not differ significantly between dose levels. Conclusions: Oral 4SC-201 has favorable disposition and can be safely administered; 600mg QD d1-5 in a 14-day cycle is recommended for phase II evaluation. Safely administered doses modulate target with antitumor activity. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '8392904', '_score': 85.906975, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Neoplasms, Vascular Tissue [D009383:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms [D012983:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Aminopterin [D000630:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/analogs & derivatives [Q000031:major]/therapeutic use [Q000627:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/adverse effects [Q000009:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Histiocytoma, Benign Fibrous [D018219:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]'], 'text': 'Edatrexate in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

Edatrexate, an investigational antifolate, is active in patients with lung cancer, and has cytotoxic activity in human sarcoma cell lines.\n\nMETHODS: Edatrexate was administered to 36 patients with measurable, advanced soft tissue sarcoma who had not previously received chemotherapy. The drug was given weekly for 5 weeks, then every other week. The initial dose, 80 mg/m2, was escalated by 10 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in the absence of toxicity.

This phase I study of trabectedin was performed to determine the recommended dose for phase II studies in Japanese patients with STS.\n\nMETHODS: Patients who had STS refractory to, or who could not tolerate, anthracycline-based chemotherapy were enrolled. The starting dose of trabectedin was 0.9 mg/m(2), given as a 24-h continuous infusion every 21 days. The dose was escalated to 1.2 mg/m(2) and then to 1.5 mg/m(2), using a "3 + 3" cohort expansion design.

However, it has not been reported whether this vesicle-mediated communication affects the malignant transformation of normal stem cells/progenitors. We have previously reported that the conditioned medium derived from the mouse Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell line can convert mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) into cancer stem cells (CSCs), indicating that normal stem cells when placed in an aberrant microenvironment can give rise to functionally active CSCs. Here, we focused on the contribution of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) that are secreted from LLC cells to induce the transformation of miPSCs into CSCs. We isolated tEVs from the conditioned medium of LLC cells, and then the differentiating miPSCs were exposed to tEVs for 4 weeks. The resultant tEV treated cells (miPS-LLCev) expressed Nanog and Oct3/4 proteins comparable to miPSCs. The frequency of sphere formation of the miPS-LLCev cells in suspension culture indicated that the self-renewal capacity of the miPS-LLCev cells was significant. When the miPS-LLCev cells were subcutaneously transplanted into Balb/c nude mice, malignant liposarcomas with extensive angiogenesis developed. miPS-LLCevPT and miPS-LLCevDT, the cells established from primary site and disseminated liposarcomas, respectively, showed their capacities to self-renew and differentiate into adipocytes and endothelial cells. Moreover, we confirmed the secondary liposarcoma development when these cells were transplanted. Taken together, these results indicate that miPS-LLCev cells possess CSC properties.

The limited treatment options available for advanced STS underline the need for reliable preclinical models to test novel therapeutic strategies.Methods: A panel of patient-derived xenografts was established and is currently expanded in nu/nu NMRI mice by subcutaneous implantation of fresh, surgically resected tumor specimens from consenting patients with STS, treated at the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium. We mainly focused on STS subtypes which harbor specific genetic alterations (e.g. translocations, gene amplifications). Once tumor growth was observed, pieces of tissue were re-transplanted to the next generation of mice. At each passage tumor fragments were collected for histological and molecular characterization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to confirm specific genomic alterations in selected xenografts. A STS xenograft model was considered established after observing maintained histological and molecular features for at least two passages.Results: Until now a total of 78 STS patient samples have been transplanted. Fifteen well-characterized, stable STS models have already been established, maintaining the features of the original tumor: myxofibrosarcoma (4 models), dedifferentiated liposarcoma (2), synovial sarcoma (2), epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (1), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2), mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (1), leiomyosarcoma (2) and sarcoma not otherwise specified (1). Some of these models have already been successfully used for in vivo testing of novel agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors or cytotoxic (pro-)drugs. Twelve other xenografts are still in early stages of engraftment, not yet fulfilling our criteria of established model.Conclusion: This newly established, representative panel of STS xenografts is characterized by stable histological and molecular features reflecting the pheno- and genotype of the original patient samples. This panel is thus well suited for in vivo drug testing of innovative agents. The unique availability of models of some ultra-rare entities will also allow us to study the biology of these diseases.

PMTs share overlapping histologic features with other types of tumors; thus, accurate pathological diagnosis may be challenging. We performed an immunohistochemical examination of FGF23 expression in PMTs and other types of tumors, together with pertinent molecular analyses.\n\nMETHODS: Seven PMTs (5 with TIO and 2 without TIO) and 46 other types of bone and soft tissue tumors were retrieved, and immunohistochemistry was performed using a commercially available anti-FGF23 antibody. In addition, FGF23 mRNA expression was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), using RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.\n\nRESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of FGF23 expression showed distinct, punctate staining in the cytoplasm in 5 PMTs with TIO, whereas FGF23 expression was negative in the 2 PMTs without TIO and the other 46 tumors. FGF23 mRNA expression was detected in all 4 PMTs examined, as well as in 1 chondromyxoid fibroma and 1 myxoid liposarcoma. The real-time RT-PCR data showed that the relative expression levels of the FGF23 mRNA tended to be higher in PMTs with TIO than in PMTs without TIO, or in the chondromyxoid fibroma specimen.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that the feasibility of immunohistochemical detection of FGF23 may depend on the level of secreted FGF23 from tumor cells. Thus, immunohistochemistry for FGF23 is an useful diagnostic adjunct for PMT, although its utility appears to be limited in cases without TIO.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '25613785', '_score': 84.49741, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Abdomen [D000005:minor]', 'Severity of Illness Index [D012720:minor]', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative [D013514:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Follow-Up Studies [D005500:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Leg [D007866:minor]', 'Lymphedema [D008209:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]/etiology [Q000209:minor]/surgery [Q000601:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Obesity, Morbid [D009767:minor]/complications [Q000150:major]'], 'text': 'The diagnostic and surgical challenges of massive localized lymphedema.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Massive localized lymphedema (MLL) is a rare entity first described in 1998 in patients with morbid obesity; the incidence is rising with the increased prevalence of morbid obesity.

The time from onset to presentation averaged 3 years (range 1 to 8 years). Two thigh lesions precluded ambulation because both legs could not be on the ground simultaneously; the 2 abdominal lesions were too heavy to permit ambulation.\n\nRESULTS: The surgical excision required the use of pulleys to elevate the MLL tissues, which, on excision, weighed between 24 and 78 lbs. A long oval horizontal incision and a long transverse incision were used for the 2 abdominal lesions. Long horizontal oval limb incisions with multiple perpendicular cross incisions had to be used to excise MLL in the 4 limb lesions. In 2 cases, the vessel-sealing device was employed successfully for dissecting subcutaneous edematous tissue. Loose wound closure permitted postoperative lymph leakage, which continued for 3 to 8 weeks. The histology demonstrated fibrotic lymphatic tissue with vascular and lymphatic proliferation and edema; all patients did well.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MLL is rare and is best treated by surgical excision facilitated by pulleys and imaginative incisions to obtain primary closure.

Trabectedin is an isoquinoline alkylating agent that, unlike other alkylating agents, binds in the DNA minor groove to initiate cytotoxic activity. Other multitarget mechanisms of action of trabectedin include important effects within the tumor microenvironment; in particular, trabectedin possesses indirect anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activity via tumor-associated macrophages and high-specificity modulation of various transcription factors. The clinical efficacy of trabectedin, administered intravenously over 24 h every 3 weeks, has been demonstrated in several studies in patients with STS.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze survival and evaluate AJCC staging.\n\nRESULTS: In 1365 patient undergoing resection of primary RPS, the most prevalent histologies were liposarcoma (50%), leiomyosarcoma (26%), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (11%). Median, 5-year, and 10-year survival after resection were 55 months, 47%, and 27%. Histological subtype (P < 0.001), histological grade (grade 3-4 vs. grade 1; HR, 2.42; P < 0.001), and tumor invasion of adjacent structures (HR, 1.37; P < 0.001) were associated with survival on multivariable analysis. However, tumor size had no prognostic value. Consequently, the AJCC T classification system demonstrated poor discriminatory ability (c = 0.50). The AJCC stage grouping system demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability (c = 0.66) but performed no better than a much simpler system that omits information on tumor size and lymph node metastasis (c = 0.67).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Indicators of tumor aggressiveness (histological grade and invasion of adjacent structures) as well as histological subtype predict survival after RPS resection. Tumor size, however, does not impact survival.

The local recurrence rate was low: LAdx 1/10, OAdx 1/20, and the median survival was 23 months. Independent prognosticators of favourable survival were adrenalectomy for potential cure (p = 0.01), no previous metastasis surgery (p = 0.02), and tumour type (p = 0.043), with better prognosis for patients with adrenal metastasis from colorectal carcinoma and RCC and worse prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgery for adrenal metastasis is safe and the indication for this procedure in an individual patient can be supported by several prognostic factors. The survival benefit in patients with adrenalectomy for potential cure indicates a therapeutic value of adrenalectomy in selected patients.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19010839', '_score': 84.49741, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Immunotoxins [D000922:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:major]', 'Neoplasms [D009369:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'RNA, Messenger [D012333:minor]/analysis [Q000032:minor]', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction [D020133:minor]', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1 [D054789:minor]/toxicity [Q000633:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Antigens, CD [D015703:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Antigens, Neoplasm [D000951:minor]/biosynthesis [Q000096:major]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Carcinoma [D002277:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]/metabolism [Q000378:major]', 'Cell Line, Tumor [D045744:minor]', 'Flow Cytometry [D005434:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Immunoglobulin G [D007074:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Immunohistochemistry [D007150:minor]'], 'text': "Endosialin protein expression and therapeutic target potential in human solid tumors: sarcoma versus carcinoma.\n\n\nPURPOSE: Endosialin/CD248/tumor endothelial marker 1 is expressed in stromal cells, endothelial cells, and pericytes in various tumors; however, few studies have focused on expression in malignant cells.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied expression of endosialin in clinical specimens, cell culture, and animal models and designed an anti-endosialin therapeutic prototype.\n\nRESULTS: Fifty human tumor cell lines and 6 normal cell types in culture were assayed by reverse transcription-PCR and/or flow cytometry for endosialin. Cell surface protein was found on 7 sarcoma lines, 1 neuroblastoma, and 4 normal cell types in culture. A fully human anti-endosialin antibody bound to human A-673 Ewing's sarcoma cells and SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cells but not HT-1080 cells. Exposure of cells to an anti-human IgG conjugated to saporin resulted in growth inhibition only of endosialin-expressing cells. Endosialin expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 250 clinical specimens of human cancer including 20 cancer subtypes. Endosialin is frequently found in human cancers. Endosialin expression is mainly a perivascular feature in carcinomas, with some expression in stromal cells. In sarcomas, endosialin is expressed by malignant cells, perivascular cells, and stromal cells. Development and characterization of experimental models for studying endosialin biology in sarcomas and evaluating anti-endosialin therapies is presented.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that an anti-endosialin immunotoxin might be a promising therapeutic approach for endosialin-positive neoplasia, especially synovial sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma, and osteosarcoma.

In addition, the clinical and epidemiological profile of this condition is summarized, based on a review of the English-language literature of all previously described cases.\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on 7 new cases of granulomatous foreign-body reaction involving the oral and perioral tissues after the injection of biomaterials. A comprehensive literature review is also presented.\n\nRESULTS: The literature search revealed 49 cases of this condition affecting the oral and perioral tissues. Our 7 patients were female, with a mean age of 52.8 years (range, 34 to 70 years). The lower lip was affected in 4 cases, 1 case was located in the upper lip, 1 case in the buccal mucosa, while 1 case involved 2 different sites (upper lip and buccal mucosa). Histopathologic examination revealed numerous cells with clear, often multiple, cytoplasmic vacuoles, bearing a resemblance to lipoblasts. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse positivity for the histiocytic marker CD68.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of granulomatous foreign-body reactions may be challenging because of their microscopic resemblance to liposarcoma, and because of the occasional reluctance of patients to report the previously performed esthetic procedure.

A variety of pleural cavity sarcomas have been described, including liposarcoma,(3) chondrosarcoma,(4) osteosarcoma,(5) and malignant schwannoma.(6) Pleural synovial sarcoma, however, is a much rarer entity. In fact, pleural synovial sarcoma was first described only 6 years ago(7) and has not yet been reported in the surgical literature. Because of its rarity, pleural synovial sarcoma is often mistaken for the histologically similar malignant mesothelioma, the most common of the pleural neoplasms. This is a critical distinction, because synovial sarcoma may be extremely aggressive. Studies in the last 10 years have shown it to be extremely sensitive to ifosfamide-based chemotherapy, and survival of patients with synovial sarcoma has recently increased with chemotherapy, with 5-year survivals now as high as 57%.(8-10) In this report, we describe 3 cases of synovial sarcoma of the pleura. Clinical findings are correlated with pathologic features, including immunohistochemical stains and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the identification of the diagnostic chromosomal translocation, t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2). This delineation of the clinical and pathologic aspects of this rare, newly recognized tumor should increase awareness among the surgical community."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '2599941', '_score': 84.49741, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Animals [D000818:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:minor]', 'Carcinoma [D002277:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:minor]', 'Dog Diseases [D004283:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:major]', 'Dogs [D004285:minor]', 'Doxorubicin [D004317:minor]/therapeutic use [Q000627:major]', 'Drug Evaluation [D004341:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:minor]', 'Lymphoma [D008223:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:minor]', 'Neoplasms [D009369:minor]/drug therapy [Q000188:minor]/veterinary [Q000662:major]', 'Prospective Studies [D011446:minor]'], 'text': 'Phase II evaluation of doxorubicin for treatment of various canine neoplasms.\n\n\nOne hundred eighty-five dogs with histologically confirmed, measurable malignant tumors were used in a prospective study to determine the response to 2 doses of the anthracycline antitumor antibiotic, doxorubicin.

The median age was 53 years (range: 14-87 years). Nine patients had primary diseases and eight had recurrent diseases. Of the 17 patients, eight refused amputation, and the remaining nine refused surgical resection. Tumors were located in the upper limbs in four patients and lower limbs in 13.

Despite bland histologic features, a significant number of these tumors metastasize. We describe the clinicopathologic features of 7 new cases of LGFMS including one case of dedifferentiation in a recurrence.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 7 cases obtained from the surgical files of the CHUQ, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec or from the consultation files were studied.\n\nRESULTS: The patients' age (5 male and 2 female) ranged from 16 to 55 years old. The tumors were located in the thigh (4), the deltoid muscle (2) and in the mesentery (1). They measured from 2.3 to 15 cm (greatest diameter). Histologically, the tumors were characteristically more fibrous than myxoid. Tumors cells were bland, oval to spindle shape, and arranged, at least in part, in a storiform or whorled growth pattern. Cellularity was most prominent in fibrous areas and there were small, sometimes curvilinear vessels in the myxoid areas. Mitotic figures were uncommon. Follow-up of patients ranged from 3 (1/2) months to 22 years. Four patients showed recurrence. One of them demonstrated an area of dedifferentiation into a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) type.

Reversal of this process may provide a novel therapeutic approach for osteopenic disorders. We have shown that cells cultured from human trabecular bone are not only osteogenic, but are able also to undergo adipocyte differentiation under defined culture conditions. Osteoblast differentiation was induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and adipocyte differentiation by dexamethasone (dex) plus 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) treatment. Adipogenesis was characterized by lineage-specific enzyme and gene activities, alpha-glycerophosphate-3-dehydrogenase activity, fatty acid binding protein, aP2 and lipoprotein lipase expression. Osteoblastogenesis was assessed by osteoblast characteristic 1,25(OH)2D3 induction of alkaline phosphatase activity and osteoblast-specific 1,25(OH)2D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis and release. We provide evidence for a common pluripotent mesenchymal stem cell that is able either to undergo adipogenesis or osteoblastogenesis, using clonal cell lines derived from human trabecular bone cell cultures. Adipogenesis can be induced also by long chain fatty acids and the thiazolidinedione troglitazone. Dex plus IBMX-induced adipogenesis can be inhibited by interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta. Interestingly, and in contrast to extramedullary adipocyte differentiation as shown by mouse 3T3L-1 and a human liposarcoma SW872 cell line, trabecular bone adipogenesis was unaffected by insulin. Also, the formation of fully differentiated adipocytes from trabecular bone cells after troglitazone treatment and long chain fatty acids was dependent on increased expression of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma2 caused by dex plus IBMX.

The latter included carcinomas of the adrenal cortex, breast, pituitary ectopic tissue, ovary (thecomas), Leydig cells of testis, thymus, pancreas,salivary glands, oribital gland (fibroadenoma), liposarcoma, and lymphoma. Many of the tissues of origin of the tumors have not been considered to be under theinfluence of estrogens. A type of hormone-responsive tumor that was inhibited by estrogen and that grew only in normal rats is described. Ali estrogens tested, including estriol , were interchangeable in action. The incidence of the more common tumors of the adrenal, breast, and pituitary was very low in normal rats, but higher in females. All tumors were more common after estrogenization in both sexes, particularyly in older animals. The secretion of steroids and pitiutary hormones by many tumors led to obvious biological effects. Pituitary secretion led to severe lesions frequently associated with diseases in humans, but the signs of such diseases in the rat apparently were hormone dependent and disappeared if the tumor was removed. The overall results raised the possiblity that estrogens were not carcinogenic per se but stimulated the growth of previously altered cells and that, following their transplantation, this hormone requirement was retained. Irrespective of the mechanism of carcinogenesis, hormone-dependent tumor growth was not irreversible but was controlled in an unexpectedly wide spectrum of organs by exogenous estrogen.

Thirty-one patients (91.2%) were discharged alive from the hospital at a median of 20 days. One-year and three-year overall survival rates were estimated at 64.7% and 42.4%, respectively. At the time of submission, 14 patients are alive and 13 are disease free with a median follow-up of 5.8 years. Conclusions: Ex-vivo tumor resection is a highly complex procedure associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Outcome for this population is dismal. Neo-/adjuvant chemotherapy (nCTX, aCTX) has been applied to eradicate micrometastases and facilitate definite surgery. Here we report on the results of our non-randomized, phase II, NeoWTS trial (EudraCT 2004-002501-72). Methods: Patients with high-risk STS (size >5cm, deep/extracompart. localization, tumor grades II-III) were included. The protocol comprised 4 cycles of nCTX (EIA, etoposide 125 mg/m2 iv day 1 and 4, ifosfamide 1500 mg/m2 iv days 14, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 day 1, pegfilgrastim 6 mg sc day 5), definitive surgery with intraoperative RTX, aRTX and 4 adjuvant cycles of EIA. MRI scans were performed every 2 cycles and assessed according to RECIST criteria. Tumorregression was graded according to Salzer-Kuntschik. Results: Between 06/2005 and 03/2010 a total of 50 subjects (male=33, female=17, median age 50.1 years) were enrolled. STS were located in the upper extremity (n=4), lower extremity (n=31), trunk (n=11) and other loc. (n=4). Histological subtypes included liposarcoma (n=12), synovial sarcoma (n=9), NOS (n=9), MFH (n=8), leiomyosarcoma (n=5), and others (n=7) with tumor grades being II (n=21) and III (n=29). Response by RECIST criteria to nCTX was NED (n=3), PR (n=12), SD (n=31) and PD (n=4). Surgical status after nCTX was R0 (n=37), R1 (n=6) and R2 (n=2). Five patients did not undergo definitive surgery. Median follow-up was 30.5 months. Local recurrence occurred in 6 subjects. Distant metastasis was observed in 14 patients. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 2 years was 83% and 63%, respectively. Median OS and DFS were not yet reached. Multivariant analysis failed to prove influence of resection status or grade of histological necrosis on OS or DFS. Severe toxicities included neutropenic fever (4/50), cardiac toxicity (2/50), and CNS toxicity (2/50) leading to CTX dose reductions in 4 subjects. Conclusions: The current protocol is feasible achieving local control rates, OS and DFS comparable to historical data on neo-/adjuvant CTX. \n\n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '27751846', '_score': 82.30881, '_source': {'mesh_terms': [], 'text': "Safety and efficacy of regorafenib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (REGOSARC): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with proven activity in refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumours and chemotherapy-refractory advanced colorectal cancers. We assessed this agent's efficacy and safety in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcomas previously treated with anthracycline.\n\nMETHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, phase 2 trial undertaken in France and Austria, we enrolled patients aged 18 years and older with advanced soft tissue sarcomas who had received previous doxorubicin or other anthracycline treatment. These patients were randomly assigned (1:1) into one of the following four cohorts: liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, and other sarcomas. Participants were treated with oral regorafenib (160 mg per day 3 weeks on and 1 week off) or matched placebo. Patients receiving placebo were offered optional crossover in case of centrally confirmed disease progression. The random allocation schedule was computer-generated with permuted blocks of four patients, with two stratification factors: country (France or Austria) and previous exposure to pazopanib (yes or no). Eligibility criteria included patients with histologically proven advanced and inoperable soft tissue sarcomas with intolerance or failure to doxorubicin or other anthracycline-based chemotherapy and at least one unidimensionally or bidimensionally measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1). The primary endpoint was RECIST-based progression-free survival after central radiological review in the intention-to-treat population. Patients, physicians, and radiologists of the panel were masked to treatment allocation. This study is still open for recruitment for an additional stratum (patients previously treated with pazopanib) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01900743.\n\nFINDINGS: From Aug 5, 2013, to Nov 26, 2014, 182 patients were randomly assigned to one of four cohorts and included in the final analysis. At the cutoff date (Jan 7, 2016), the number of required events was reached for the four cohorts. In the liposarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 1·1 months (95% CI 0·9-2·3) with regorafenib versus 1·7 months (0·9-1·8) with placebo (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·48-1·64] p=0·70). In the leiomyosarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 3·7 months (95% CI 2·5-5·0) with regorafenib versus 1·8 (1·0-2·8) months with placebo (HR 0·46 [95% CI 0·46-0·80] p=0·0045). In the synovial sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 1·4-11·6) with regorafenib versus 1·0 (0·8-1·4) with placebo (HR 0·10 [95% CI 0·03-0·35] p<0·0001). In the other sarcoma cohort, progression-free survival was 2·9 months (95% CI 1·0-7·8) with regorafenib versus 1·0 (0·9-1·9) with placebo (HR 0·46 [95% CI 0·25-0·81] p=0·0061). Before crossover, the most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were arterial hypertension (17 [19%] events in the 89 patients in the regorafenib group vs two [2%] events in the 92 patients in the placebo group), hand and foot skin reaction (14 [15%] vs no events) and asthenia (12 [13%] vs six [6%]). One treatment-related death occurred in the regorafenib group due to liver failure.\n\nINTERPRETATION: Regorafenib has an important clinical antitumour effect in non-adipocytic soft tissue sarcomas, improving progression-free survival. Regorafenib should be further evaluated in this setting, and its therapeutic role has to be defined in the context of the growing therapeutic armamentarium, already including one approved multikinase inhibitor, pazopanib.\n\nFUNDING: Bayer HealthCare."}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_188487-199', '_score': 81.84067, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2017 ASCO Annual Meeting Abstracts\nTitle: Clinical characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) with mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations.\n\n\nBackground: Tumors with mismatch repair-deficiency (MMRD) have a high mutational burden and have good responses to immunotherapy (Le, NEJM, 2015). We describe the natural course, clinicopathological, and genomic status of MMRD PDAC patients (pts) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Methods: MSKCC institutional registry and ICD billing database queried from 2006-2016 for PDAC pts with genetically confirmed mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Mutation # determined via MSK-IMPACT, a targeted tumor next generation sequencing (NGS) test (Cheng, J Mol Diagn, 2015). Results: 5/607 (0.8%) PDAC pts had Lynch syndrome (LS) (confirmed germline mutations) (Table 1). Of the 5 LS pts, all had > 10 mutations in NGS, with 4 of 5 having > 50 mutations. 4 of 5 (80%) are alive at last follow-up (survival 30-314 months). N=4 had extensive personal/family history of cancer. Of N=3 who had resected disease, all 3 had recurrence at 11, 49 and 311 months, and all are alive (survival: 69-314 months). Of N= 2 pts that had unresectable tumors, one passed away at 30 months while the other is on checkpoint inhibitor trial and is alive at 30 months. In contrast, 7/607 (1.1%) PDAC pts had somatic mutations in MMR genes with an average of 5.7 mutations in NGS, with 4/7 having <5 mutations. 4/7 (57%) are deceased at last follow-up (survival: 10-42 months). Conclusions: All cases with germline mutations in the MMR genes, with one exception, had high mutation #. All cases with somatic mutations in the MMR genes had low mutation #. Germline mutations in MMR genes and high mutational burden may predict for a prognostically favorable subgroup of PDAC pts with high susceptibility to immune oncology agents.

Minimal breast cancer was defined as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or node-negative invasive breast cancer < 1 cm in size.\n\nRESULTS: Of 144 women, 44 (31% [95% CI, 15-29%]) underwent biopsies prompted by MRI examination. Biopsies revealed malignancies in 17 women (12% [95% CI, 7-18%]) and benign findings only in 27 women (19% [95% CI, 13-26%]). Of the 17 women in whom cancer was detected, seven also had benign biopsy results. In total, 18 malignancies were found. One woman had two metachronous cancers.

Following resection of all gross disease, patients were randomized to the BRT arm (n = 22) or to the no-BRT arm (n = 23). On the fifth or sixth postoperative day, catheters were loaded with iridium 192 to deliver a dose of 45 Gy to the tumor bed over 4 to 6 days.\n\nRESULTS: The two groups were evenly distributed with respect to the distribution of presentation status (primary v recurrent), tumor site (trunk v extremity, proximal v distal extremity), tumor size (< 5 cm v > or = 5 cm), tumor depth (superficial v deep), and microscopic tumor margins (positive v negative). The predominant histopathologic diagnosis in each group was liposarcoma (BRT, 13 of 22 [59%]; no BRT, 14 of 23 [61%]) with other histopathologic subtypes evenly distributed between the two groups.

Most cases of ALS are sporadic, but about 10% are familial. Genes known to cause classic familial ALS (FALS) are superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), ANG encoding angiogenin, TARDP encoding transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein TDP-43 (ref. 4) and fused in sarcoma/translated in liposarcoma (FUS, also known as TLS). However, these genetic defects occur in only about 20-30% of cases of FALS, and most genes causing FALS are unknown. Here we show that there are mutations in the gene encoding optineurin (OPTN), earlier reported to be a causative gene of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), in patients with ALS. We found three types of mutation of OPTN: a homozygous deletion of exon 5, a homozygous Q398X nonsense mutation and a heterozygous E478G missense mutation within its ubiquitin-binding domain. Analysis of cell transfection showed that the nonsense and missense mutations of OPTN abolished the inhibition of activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and the E478G mutation revealed a cytoplasmic distribution different from that of the wild type or a POAG mutation. A case with the E478G mutation showed OPTN-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. Furthermore, TDP-43- or SOD1-positive inclusions of sporadic and SOD1 cases of ALS were also noticeably immunolabelled by anti-OPTN antibodies. Our findings strongly suggest that OPTN is involved in the pathogenesis of ALS. They also indicate that NF-kappaB inhibitors could be used to treat ALS and that transgenic mice bearing various mutations of OPTN will be relevant in developing new drugs for this disorder.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '19704258', '_score': 81.70482, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Fixatives [D005404:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma, Alveolar [D018232:minor]/diagnosis [Q000175:major]', 'Sensitivity and Specificity [D012680:minor]', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1 [D000071161:minor]', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors [D051858:minor]/genetics [Q000235:minor]', 'Formaldehyde [D005557:minor]/pharmacology [Q000494:minor]', 'Gene Rearrangement [D015321:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence [D017404:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]', 'Paraffin Embedding [D016612:minor]', 'Pathology [D010336:minor]/methods [Q000379:major]'], 'text': 'The utility of FOXO1 fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens in the diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.\n\n\nAlveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive neoplasm with unique t(2;13)(q35;q14) or t(1;13)(p36;q14) chromosomal translocations, resulting in PAX3/FOXO1 and PAX7/FOXO1 fusion genes, in approximately 80% of cases.

The medical records were reviewed and clinical and pathologic data collected.\n\nRESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 46 years for patients with melanoma and 50 years for patients with sarcoma, which was consistent with population-based data. Among patients with STS (n = 41), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNT) were more common in patients with both diagnoses (5 of 41; 13%) when compared with all adults with STS admitted to the study center between 1982 to date (125 of 2901; 4%; P < 0.05). Liposarcoma occurred in only 1 patient with both melanoma and STS (1 of 41; 2%), despite the fact that it was the most common histologic diagnosis in all adults with STS (625 of 2901; 22%; P < 0.001). The anatomic site of STS was more commonly visceral (11 of 41; 27%) when compared with all adults with STS (424 of 2901; 15%; P < 0.05). A positive family history of cancer was noted in 50% of the patients, and 25% of patients had a third primary tumor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Although a distinct "melanoma/sarcoma" syndrome was not identified, MPNT as well as visceral sarcomas were more common than expected in this study.

A simple assessment comprising clinical examination, full blood count and differential white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, protein electrophoresis, chest x-ray and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was performed on admission in 75 cases of presumably idiopathic DVT and revealed a cancer in 10 cases: 6 women and 4 men with a mean age of 53 years. Cancers were located in the urogenital tract in 5 cases, in the bronchi in 2 cases, in the stomach in one case, and there was one case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and another case of liposarcoma of the left iliac fossa. The histological type most frequently encountered was adenocarcinoma in 6 cases. In 9 out of 10 cases, the cancer was discovered at the stage of metastases. However, a localized cancer was detected in one case, in which surgical treatment allowed cure of the patient. Comparison of the various characteristics of DVT between the group of DVT revealing a cancer and the group of DVT which remained idiopathic did not reveal any statistically significant difference. A simple, inexpensive assessment looking for a cancer must be systematically performed in all cases of idiopathic DVT in patients between the ages of 50 and 85 years.

D. Anderson Cancer Center. A retrospective review of disease outcome, patterns of relapse and patient survival was performed.\n\nRESULTS: Histological subtypes of sarcoma were malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 12 patients, leiomyosarcoma in 6, liposarcoma in 8 and other subtypes in 6. All except 2 patients underwent radical orchiectomy with or without additional resection to achieve negative margins. Margins were microscopically negative in 29 cases and positive in 3. There were 3 patients who received adjuvant radiation to the surgical site. With a median followup of 9 years the 10 and 15-year actuarial local control, distant metastasis-free and overall survival rates were 72% and 61%, 85% and 85%, and 63% and 52%, respectively. The major pattern of failure was local recurrence that occurred in 8 of the 12 patients in whom disease relapsed and was the sole site of relapse in 7. Pelvic nodes had relapsed in 2 patients and para-aortic nodes in 1. Hematogenous metastases had developed in 4 patients. Of the 7 cases of disease that recurred locally only 3 were salvaged. No relapse occurred in the 3 patients treated with combined surgery and radiation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Spermatic cord sarcoma has a high propensity for local recurrence after surgery. Nodal relapse is less frequent than commonly believed. Because of the relatively high local failure rate seen in surgery alone and durable local control noted in 3 patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy, combined modality treatment should be considered in those with spermatic cord sarcoma who are believed to be at high risk for local failure.'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': '16955508', '_score': 81.70482, '_source': {'mesh_terms': ['Adult [D000328:minor]', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging [D008279:minor]', 'Male [D008297:minor]', 'Middle Aged [D008875:minor]', 'Piperazines [D010879:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Polyvinyl Alcohol [D011142:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Pyrimidines [D011743:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Sarcoma [D012509:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/pathology [Q000473:major]/therapy [Q000628:major]', 'Treatment Outcome [D016896:minor]', 'Aged [D000368:minor]', 'Antineoplastic Agents [D000970:minor]/administration & dosage [Q000008:minor]', 'Benzamides [D001549:minor]', 'Chemoembolization, Therapeutic [D016461:major]', 'Female [D005260:minor]', 'Humans [D006801:minor]', 'Imatinib Mesylate [D000068877:minor]', 'Liver Neoplasms [D008113:minor]/mortality [Q000401:minor]/secondary [Q000556:major]/therapy [Q000628:major]'], 'text': 'Treatment of metastatic sarcoma to the liver with bland embolization.\n\n\nBACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the impact of bland particle embolization on survival in patients with metastatic sarcoma to the liver.\n\nMETHODS: Twenty-four patients with liver-dominant metastases from sarcoma were treated with particle embolization from 1996 to 2002. Primary tumors included 16 gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), 7 intestinal leiomyosarcomas, and 1 liposarcoma. Thirteen patients had known extrahepatic disease. Embolization was performed by using polyvinyl alcohol or trisacryl microspheres to effect stasis in the target vessel(s). Follow-up images to assess response were obtained 4 weeks after the procedure. Decrease in the size of the target lesion by >25% or development of >50% necrosis on follow-up imaging was considered a treatment response.\n\nRESULTS: Nineteen patients had metachronous liver metastases, and the median disease-free interval was 22 months (range 10-156 months) from resection of the primary tumor. Ten patients underwent prior liver resection for metastatic disease. Of 15 evaluable patients, 9 patients (60%) had a radiographic response. The median follow-up for all patients was 21 months. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 59 months. Overall survival from the time of initial embolization was 62% at 1 year, 41% at 2 years, and 29% at 3 years.

Mechanisms of action may be multifold: induction of DNA damage, involving specific and peculiar DNA repair pathways, and transcriptional interference. The latter mechanism may be more significant in myxoid liposarcomas. Other translocation-related sarcomas may be sensitive to T. SS is a translocation-related sarcoma. We report on a series of 39 pts with advanced SS who were treated with T in three European sarcoma centres within compassionate-use programs.

Endosialin (TEM-1/CD248) is a cell surface glycoprotein expressed on cells involved in the development of tumor vasculature, but has generally limited expression in normal tissue.

In the univariate analysis we didn't found statistical differences according to clinical & pathological factors, stage and recurrence, on OS or PFS. Conclusions: CPh have better prognosis than other BS although its stage or size tends to be higher. Radical surgery in BS should be always considered as first treatment option.

Previous studies demonstrated several clinical and dosimetric parameters of AET in patients with lung cancer. However, there are few reports dealing with these variables in intra-thoracic malignancies, including lung cancer and other thoracic malignancy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and dosimetric factors associated with AET in patients with intra-thoracic malignancies. We examined 61 patients with intra-thoracic malignancies treated with radiotherapy: 34 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (55%), 9 cases with small-cell lung cancer (15%), 7 cases with thymic cancer (11%), 4 thymomas (7%), 2 malignant lymphomas (3%), one seminoma (2%), one liposarcoma (2%), and 3 cases of other malignancies (5%). Radiotherapy was performed with a median dose of 60 Gray (Gy) (range 40-67 Gy). AET was graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. The following parameters were analyzed with respect to associations with AET by univariate and multivariate analyses: age, gender, thoracic surgery before radiotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, duration of radiotherapy, maximum esophageal dose, mean esophageal dose, and percentage of esophageal volume receiving from 10 Gy (V10) to 65 Gy (V65), in 5-Gy increments. 43 patients (70%) developed AET: 36 patients (59%) with AET of RTOG Grade 1, 7 patients (11%) with Grade 2, and no patients (0%) with Grade 3 or worse. On multivariate analysis, V35 > 30% was the most statistically significant factor associated with mild AET (p = 0.013).

Histological appearance is determined by gene expression. Morphologic features are generally good predictors of biologic behavior, however, metastatic propensity, tumor growth, and response to chemotherapy may be determined by gene expression patterns that do not correlate well with morphology. One approach to identify heterogeneity is to search for genetic markers that correlate with differences in tumor behavior. Alternatively, subsets may be identified based on gene expression patterns alone, independent of knowledge of clinical outcome. We have reported gene expression patterns that distinguish two subgroups of clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), and other gene expression patterns that distinguish heterogeneity of serous ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) and aggressive fibromatosis (AF). In this study, gene expression in 53 samples of STS and AF [including 16 malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), 9 leiomyosarcoma, 12 liposarcoma, 4 synovial sarcoma, and 12 samples of AF] was determined at Gene Logic Inc.

Hierarchical clustering of the STS using our three previously reported gene sets, each generated subgroups within the STS that for some subtypes correlated with histology, and also suggested the existence of subsets of MFH. All three gene sets also recognized the same two subsets of the fibromatosis samples that we had found in our earlier study of AF. These results suggest that these subgroups may have biological significance, and that these gene sets may be useful for sub-classification of STS.

The aim of the present study is to assess the accuracy of computed tomography (CT)-guided core needle biopsy of musculoskeletal tumours.\n\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective study on a series of 127 patients with a musculoskeletal tumour. The biopsies were performed over a 4-year period from 1998 to 2001. The accuracy of the CT-guided core needle biopsy was determined by comparing the histology of the biopsy with the final histology of the specimen obtained at open biopsy or surgical resection of the tumour. The effective accuracy was determined by the accuracy of the biopsy to distinguish between a benign and malignant tumour.\n\nRESULTS: Computed tomography guided core needle biopsy in the present series has an overall accuracy of 80.3%. The effective accuracy as determined by a malignant versus benign lesion was 89%. There were 86 malignant tumours with a biopsy accuracy of 81.4% and there were 41 benign tumours with a biopsy accuracy of 78%. The positive predictive value (PPV) of a malignant tumour is 98.9% and the PPV of benign tumour 90.2%. The most common site of biopsy was from the femur and thigh, together accounting for 39.4% of the tumours. The most common tumours in this series were liposarcoma (n = 12), osteosarcoma (n = 11) and giant cell tumour (n = 11).

We previously disclosed this accumulation in circulating lymphomonocytes (CLM) of ALS patients with mutant TARDBP, the TDP-43-coding gene, as well as of a healthy individual carrying the parental TARDBP mutation. Here, we investigate TDP-43 subcellular localization in CLM and in the constituent cells, lymphocytes and monocytes, of patients with various ALS-linked mutant genes.\n\nMETHODS: TDP-43 subcellular localization was analysed with western immunoblotting and immunocytofluorescence in CLM of healthy controls (n = 10), patients with mutant TARDBP (n = 4, 1 homozygous), valosin-containing protein (VCP; n = 2), fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS; n = 2), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; n = 6), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72; n = 4), without mutations (n = 5) and neurologically unaffected subjects with mutant TARDBP (n = 2).\n\nRESULTS: TDP-43 cytoplasmic accumulation was found (P < 0.05 vs. controls) in CLM of patients with mutant TARDBP or VCP, but not FUS, in line with TDP-43 subcellular localization described for motor neurons of corresponding groups.

Local recurrence was defined as new tumor growth more than 2 months after the initial surgery in the same region where the primary tumor occurred.

While the expression profile of bone marrow derived MSCs and their in vitro differentiation potential have been examined extensively, knowledge regarding the in vivo counterparts of MSC is still evolving. We hypothesized that MSC-like cells within STS could represent sarcoma initiating cells. Methods: To target rare human cell populations including MSCs, an exclusive antibody panel was developed. The target antigens include platelet-derived growth factor receptor- (CD140b), HER-2/erbB2 (CD340), TNFRSF16 (CD217), frizzled-4 (CD344), the recently described W8B2 antigen, as well as several surface antigens identified by novel antibodies. To define the expression pattern of MSC-markers in STS, both cell lines and primary tumor samples in suspension and in snap frozen sections were investigated. To reveal functional differences between identified rare tumor populations single cell proliferation kinetics were investigated after FACS-sorting. Results: All cell lines und primary tumor samples revealed expression of selected markers. Antigens identifying subpopulations within all sarcoma samples investigated, were selected for functional studies. These included frizzled-4, TNFRSF16, W5C5 and W8B2. Liposarcoma (SW872), leiomyosarcoma (SK-LMS) and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell lines enclosed subpopulations with differential expression of above markers and by FACS based limiting dilution it was demonstrated that only fractions of viable cells contained proliferative capacity. Cells lacking expression of CD271 had lower proliferative capacity compared to mock sorted HT1080 or SK-LMS, while CD271+ SW872 had significantly higher proliferation. The antigen defined by W5C5 identified cells with high proliferative capacity compared to control in SW872 and SK-LMS and its lack in HT1080 identified a subpopulation with largely reduced proliferation. Conclusions: Subpopulations within STS cell lines and primary sarcoma tissue express novel MSC-markers and display increased proliferative capacity, potentially reflecting the existence of sarcoma initiating cells. \n'}}, {'_index': 'abstracts', '_type': 'abstracts', '_id': 'ASCO_34219-65', '_score': 80.76057, '_source': {'mesh_terms': None, 'text': 'Meeting: 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting\nTitle: Early results of a PMH Phase II Consortium trial of AZD0530 in advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS).\n\n\nBackground: AZD0530 is a novel oral anilino quinazoline that is selective for c-Src, c-Yes, Lck, and Bcr-Abl through ATP competitive and reversible inhibition of the target enzyme. Src kinases play a role in tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis as well as being part of the signaling cascade for angiogenesis and growth factors. Advanced STS have limited therapeutic options; therefore we tested the efficacy of AZD0530 in advanced STS. Methods: The study utilized a Simon Two stage design with the primary endpoint be objective tumor response + prolonged stable disease rate (defined as partial/complete response by RECIST, or stable disease >4 months). Patients with measurable advanced STS with up to one prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were eligible for study participation following informed consent. Patients were excluded for cardiac dysfunction, poorly controlled hypertension, inability to swallow or absorb medication. Patients had pulmonary function tests at baseline that were repeated within the first 4 weeks of therapy. Results: 17 patients (11 F, 6M) with advanced STS (leiomyosarcoma 5, rhabdomyosarcoma 3, MFH/carcinosarcoma/Fibrosarcoma 2, endometrial stromal sarcoma/liposarcoma/non-rhabdoSTS 1 each) were enrolled, the majority of whom had prior therapy (14 chemo and 9 xrt). Five continue on study. Nine discontinued therapy for progressive disease, 2 for toxicity and 1 patient request. Median time to progression in the 13 patients was 1.7 months. Possibly related severe adverse events (all grade 3) included fatigue (2), anemia/lymphopenia/hypokalemia (1 each). To date no confirmed responses have been seen. No drug related pulmonary toxicity has been observed. Conclusions: AZD0530 can be administered safely as a single agent in patients with a variety of advanced STS. To date, tumor responses have not been noted; however patients were not selected based on tumor target expression. Further testing may be warranted in selected tumors in combination with chemotherapy given pre-clinical synergy data or in tumors pre-selected for target expression. \n'}}]
